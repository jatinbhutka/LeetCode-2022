# Function to check if a singly linked list is palindrome

METHOD 1 (Use a Stack):
- A simple solution is to use a stack of list nodes. This mainly involves three steps.
- Traverse the given list from head to tail and push every visited node to stack.
- Traverse the list again. For every visited node, pop a node from the stack and compare data of popped node with the currently visited node.
- If all nodes matched, then return true, else false.

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self,data):
         
        self.data = data
        self.ptr = None
         
# Function to check if the linked list
# is palindrome or not
def ispalindrome(head):
    stack = []
    slow = head
    while slow:
        stack.append(slow.data)
        slow = slow.ptr
        
    slow = head
    flag = "True"
    while slow:
        if slow.data != stack[-1]:
            flag = "False"
        stack.pop()
        slow = slow.ptr
    return flag
            
 
# Addition of linked list
one = Node(1)
two = Node(2)
three = Node(6)
four = Node(7)
five = Node(6)
six = Node(2)
seven = Node(-11)
 
# Initialize the next pointer
# of every current pointer
one.ptr = two
two.ptr = three
three.ptr = four
four.ptr = five
five.ptr = six
six.ptr = seven
seven.ptr = None
 
# Call function to check palindrome or not
result = ispalindrome(one)
 
print("isPalindrome:", result)
```
#### Time complexity: O(n)



METHOD 2 (By reversing the list) 
This method takes O(n) time and O(1) extra space. 
1) Get the middle of the linked list. 
2) Reverse the second half of the linked list. 
3) Check if the first half and second half are identical. 
4) Construct the original linked list by reversing the second half again and attaching it back to the first half

```python
```
