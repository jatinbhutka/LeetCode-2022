# Linked List:

Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.

A linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node of the linked list. The first node is called the head. If the linked list is empty, then the value of the head points to NULL. 
Each node in a list consists of at least two parts: 
1) Data (we can store integer, strings or any type of data).
2) Pointer (Or Reference) to the next node (connects one node to another)

Why Linked List? 
Arrays have the following limitations. 
1) The size of the arrays is fixed: So we must know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance. Also, generally, the allocated memory is equal to the upper limit irrespective of the usage. 
2) Inserting a new element in an array of elements is expensive because the room has to be created for the new elements and to create room existing elements have to be shifted but in Linked list if we have the head node then we can traverse to any node through it and insert new node at the required position.
For example, in a system, if we maintain a sorted list of IDs in an array id[]. 
id[] = [1000, 1010, 1050, 2000, 2040]. 
And if we want to insert a new ID 1005, then to maintain the sorted order, we have to move all the elements after 1000 (excluding 1000). 
Deletion is also expensive with arrays until unless some special techniques are used. For example, to delete 1010 in id[], everything after 1010 has to be moved due to this so much work is being done which affects the efficiency of the code.

Advantages over arrays 
1) Dynamic size 
2) Ease of insertion/deletion

Drawbacks: 
1) Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node(head node). So we cannot do binary search with linked lists efficiently with its default implementation. Read about it here. 
2) Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list. 
3) Not cache friendly. Since array elements are contiguous locations, there is locality of reference which is not there in case of linked lists.


``` python
# Node class
class Node:
    # Function to initialize the node object
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data  # Assign data
        self.next = None  # Initialize next as null
        
# Linked List class
class LinkedList: 
    # Function to initialize the Linked List object
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
```        


Let us create a simple linked list with 3 nodes:

```python
# A simple Python program to introduce a linked list
 
# Node class
class Node:
 
    # Function to initialise the node object
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data  # Assign data
        self.next = None  # Initialize next as null
 
 
# Linked List class contains a Node object
class LinkedList:
 
    # Function to initialize head
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
 
 
# Code execution starts here
if __name__=='__main__':
 
    # Start with the empty list
    llist = LinkedList()
 
    llist.head = Node(1)
    second = Node(2)
    third = Node(3)
 
    '''
    Three nodes have been created.
    We have references to these three blocks as head,
    second and third
 
    llist.head        second              third
         |                |                  |
         |                |                  |
    +----+------+     +----+------+     +----+------+
    | 1  | None |     | 2  | None |     |  3 | None |
    +----+------+     +----+------+     +----+------+
    '''
 
    llist.head.next = second; # Link first node with second
 
    '''
    Now next of first Node refers to second.  So they
    both are linked.
 
    llist.head        second              third
         |                |                  |
         |                |                  |
    +----+------+     +----+------+     +----+------+
    | 1  |  o-------->| 2  | null |     |  3 | null |
    +----+------+     +----+------+     +----+------+
    '''
 
    second.next = third; # Link second node with the third node
 
    '''
    Now next of second Node refers to third.  So all three
    nodes are linked.
 
    llist.head        second              third
         |                |                  |
         |                |                  |
    +----+------+     +----+------+     +----+------+
    | 1  |  o-------->| 2  |  o-------->|  3 | null |
    +----+------+     +----+------+     +----+------+
    '''

How to access and print data in Node:

``` python
# A simple Python program for traversal of a linked list
 
# Node class
class Node:
 
    # Function to initialise the node object
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data  # Assign data
        self.next = None  # Initialize next as null
 
 
# Linked List class contains a Node object
class LinkedList:
 
    # Function to initialize head
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
 
    # This function prints contents of linked list
    # starting from head
    def printList(self):
        temp = self.head
        while (temp):
            print (temp.data)
            temp = temp.next
 
 
# Code execution starts here
if __name__=='__main__':
 
    # Start with the empty list
    llist = LinkedList()
 
    llist.head = Node(1)
    second = Node(2)
    third = Node(3)
 
    llist.head.next = second; # Link first node with second
    second.next = third; # Link second node with the third node
 
    llist.printList()
```


Major differences are listed below: 

Size: Since data can only be stored in contiguous blocks of memory in an array, its size cannot be altered at runtime due to the risk of overwriting other data. However, in a linked list, each node points to the next one such that data can exist at scattered (non-contiguous) addresses; this allows for a dynamic size that can change at runtime.
Memory allocation: For arrays at compile time and at runtime for linked lists. but, a dynamically allocated array also allocates memory at runtime.
Memory efficiency: For the same number of elements, linked lists use more memory as a reference to the next node is also stored along with the data. However, size flexibility in linked lists may make them use less memory overall; this is useful when there is uncertainty about size or there are large variations in the size of data elements; memory equivalent to the upper limit on the size has to be allocated (even if not all of it is being used) while using arrays, whereas linked lists can increase their sizes step-by-step proportionately to the amount of data.
Execution time: Any element in an array can be directly accessed with its index; however in the case of a linked list, all the previous elements must be traversed to reach any element. Also, better cache locality in arrays (due to contiguous memory allocation) can significantly improve performance. As a result, some operations (such as modifying a certain element) are faster in arrays, while some others (such as inserting/deleting an element in the data) are faster in linked lists.
Following are the points in favor of Linked Lists. 
(1) The size of the arrays is fixed: So we must know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance. Also, generally, the allocated memory is equal to the upper limit irrespective of the usage, and in practical uses, the upper limit is rarely reached. 

(2) Inserting a new element in an array of elements is expensive because room has to be created for the new elements and to create room existing elements have to be shifted. 

For example, suppose we maintain a sorted list of IDs in an array id[ ]. 

id[ ] = [1000, 1010, 1050, 2000, 2040, â€¦..]. 

And if we want to insert a new ID 1005, then to maintain the sorted order, we have to move all the elements after 1000 (excluding 1000). 

Deletion is also expensive with arrays unless some special techniques are used. For example, to delete 1010 in id[], everything after 1010 has to be moved. 

So Linked list provides the following two advantages over arrays 
1) Dynamic size 
2) Ease of insertion/deletion 

Linked lists have the following drawbacks: 
1) Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node. So we cannot do a binary search with linked lists. 
2) Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list. 
3) Arrays have better cache locality that can make a pretty big difference in performance.

4) It takes a lot of time in traversing and changing the pointers.

5)  It will be confusing when we work with pointers.
