# Detect loop in a linked list:

Given a linked list, check if the linked list has loop or not. Below diagram shows a linked list with a loop.

# Solution 1: Hashing Approach:
Traverse the list one by one and keep putting the node addresses in a Hash Table. At any point, if NULL is reached then return false, and if the next of the current nodes points to any of the previously stored nodes in  Hash then return true.

```python

class Node:
 
    # Constructor to initialize
    # the node object
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
 
 
class LinkedList:
 
    # Function to initialize head
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
 
    # Function to insert a new
    # node at the beginning
    def push(self, new_data):
        new_node = Node(new_data)
        new_node.next = self.head
        self.head = new_node
 
    # Utility function to print it
    # the linked LinkedList
    def printList(self):
        temp = self.head
        while(temp):
            print(temp.data, end=" ")
            temp = temp.next
 
    def detectLoop(self):
        s = set()
        temp = self.head
        while (temp):
 
            # If we have already has
            # this node in hashmap it
            # means their is a cycle
            # (Because you we encountering
            # the node second time).
            if (temp in s):
                return True
 
            # If we are seeing the node for
            # the first time, insert it in hash
            s.add(temp)
 
            temp = temp.next
 
        return False
 
 
# Driver program for testing
llist = LinkedList()
llist.push(20)
llist.push(4)
llist.push(15)
llist.push(10)
 
# Create a loop for testing
llist.head.next.next.next.next = llist.head
 
if(llist.detectLoop()):
    print("Loop found")
else:
    print("No Loop ")
```

### Complexity Analysis:  

#### Time complexity: O(n) ---> Only one traversal of the loop is needed.
#### Auxiliary Space: O(n) ---> n is the space required to store the value in hashmap.


# Solution 2: This problem can be solved without hashmap by modifying the linked list data structure. 
Approach: This solution requires modifications to the basic linked list data structure. 

Have a visited flag with each node.
Traverse the linked list and keep marking visited nodes.
If you see a visited node again then there is a loop. This solution works in O(n) but requires additional information with each node.
A variation of this solution that doesn’t require modification to basic data structure can be implemented using a hash, just store the addresses of visited nodes in a hash and if you see an address that already exists in hash then there is a loop.


```python

# Python3 program to detect loop in a linked list
  
''' Link list node '''
class Node:
     
    def __init__(self):
        self.data = 0
        self.next = None
        self.flag = 0
     
def push(head_ref, new_data):
 
    ''' allocate node '''
    new_node = Node();
  
    ''' put in the data '''
    new_node.data = new_data;
  
    new_node.flag = 0;
  
    ''' link the old list off the new node '''
    new_node.next = (head_ref);
  
    ''' move the head to point to the new node '''
    (head_ref) = new_node;   
    return head_ref
 
# Returns true if there is a loop in linked list
# else returns false.
def detectLoop(h):
 
    while (h != None):
        # If this node is already traverse
        # it means there is a cycle
        # (Because you we encountering the
        # node for the second time).
        if (h.flag == 1):
            return True;
  
        # If we are seeing the node for
        # the first time, mark its flag as 1
        h.flag = 1;
        h = h.next;  
    return False;
 
''' Driver program to test above function'''
if __name__=='__main__':
     
    ''' Start with the empty list '''
    head = None;
  
    head = push(head, 20);
    head = push(head, 4);
    head = push(head, 15);
    head = push(  head, 10)
  
    ''' Create a loop for testing '''
    head.next.next.next.next = head;
  
    if (detectLoop(head)):
        print("Loop found")
    else:
        print("No Loop")
```


### Complexity Analysis:  

#### Time complexity:O(n) ---> Only one traversal of the loop is needed.
#### Auxiliary Space:O(1) ---> No extra space is needed.


# Solution 3: Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm 
Approach: This is the fastest method and has been described below:  

Traverse linked list using two pointers.
Move one pointer(slow_p) by one and another pointer(fast_p) by two.
If these pointers meet at the same node then there is a loop. If pointers do not meet then linked list doesn’t have a loop.
