# Creational Design Pattern:

There are 3 main diff types of design pattern?

Creational Design Pattern: To create and Intialize classes
- Factory
- Singleton
- Abstract Factory



# 1. Factory Design Patterm:

Example: Client Req is to create Vehicle object and give back to client. Vehicle can be bus, auto, truck...

#### We can create Vehicle base class and Inherit vehicle class and create child class Bus, Truck, 2Wheeler, 4wheeler to solve problem

```python
# Online Python compiler (interpreter) to run Python online.
# Write Python 3 code in this online editor and run it.

class Vehicle:
    
    # Abstract Method - Any class that inherits properties from this class have to define createVehicle Method in it
    def createVehicle(self):
        pass
        
class Car(Vehicle):
    def createVehicle(self):
        print('Created Car class')
        
class Bike(Vehicle):
    def createVehicle(self):
        print('Created Bike class')
        
c = Car()
c.createVehicle()

b = Bike()
b.createVehicle()


'''
o/p:
Created Car class
Created Bike class
 
'''
'''
```

Problem with Above is,
^^ will work find when we create Bike or Car object. What happend when we want to create object for 'Truck' new type of Vehice?. This is very tightly couple.


So, Here we will use Factory (Factory means creation). It will take care of of creation logic. So, creational logic is now no more couple with clinet. so its loosely couple


```python
class vehicleFactory:
    
    def getVehicle(self, vehicleType):
        if VehickeType == ' Car':
            return Car.createVehicle()
        elif vehicleType == 'Bike':
            return bike.createVehicle()
        else:
            print('Not Present')
```

We will use FACTORY class to interact with client. So client doesn't have to interact with product class directly.and its loosely coupled with Prodfuct.
Client doesn't need to worry about the how implementation is happening. It just class factory to get the clasess. 


### Factory Design Pattern Summary:
- Suppose we have Bike/Car/Bus diifferent types of Vehicle. We need to create different object for given type of Vehicle.
- Instead of using if...else condition at client side, we can check and have if...else in factory class.
- Client doesn't take care of creating Object.
- So, if we need to add another vehicle type. (eg. Auto), we don't have to worry about changing Client.
- We have De-couple the client using factory class. Client will be running smoothly.

# SingleTon design Pattern:

SingleTop is another creational design pattern type. **Means we will create single instance of the class. We will create only one object of the class. We will make sure no other class is require**

- If you have only one DB connection using in entire Project
- Or you have one config. mamnager.
- Or you have only one logger system, where entire log should goes into only one logger place

In this case we will **SingleTop Design pattern**.



```
# Create

We have 3 files:
# logger.hpp ---> Logger class
# user.cpp ----> User will use logger class
# logger.cpp



# logger.hpp ---> Logger class

```

# Restrict users from creating Object to convert it into singletop Design pattern

# ClassMethod v/s Static Method:
