# Creational Design Pattern:

There are 3 main diff types of design pattern?

Creational Design Pattern: To create and Intialize classes
- Factory
- Abstract Factory
- Singleton


1. Factory Design Patterm:

Example: Client Req is to create Vehicle object and give back to client. Vehicle can be bus, auto, truck...

#### We can create Vehicle base class and Inherit vehicle class and create child class Bus, Truck, 2Wheeler, 4wheeler to solve problem

```python
# Online Python compiler (interpreter) to run Python online.
# Write Python 3 code in this online editor and run it.

class Vehicle:
    
    # Abstract Method - Any class that inherits properties from this class have to define createVehicle Method in it
    def createVehicle(self):
        pass
        
class Car(Vehicle):
    def createVehicle(self):
        print('Created Car class')
        
class Bike(Vehicle):
    def createVehicle(self):
        print('Created Bike class')
        
c = Car()
c.createVehicle()

b = Bike()
b.createVehicle()


'''
o/p:
Created Car class
Created Bike class
 
'''
'''
```

Problem with Above is,
^^ will work find when we create Bike or Car object. What happend when we want to create object for 'Truck' new type of Vehice?. This is very tightly couple.


So, Here we will use Factory (Factory means creation). It will take care of of creation logic. So, creational logic is now no more couple with clinet. so its loosely couple


```python
class vehicleFactory:
    
    def getVehicle(self, vehicleType):
        if VehickeType == ' Car':
            return Car.createVehicle()
        elif vehicleType == 'Bike':
            return bike.createVehicle()
        else:
            print('Not Present')
```

We will use FACTORY class to interact with client. So client doesn't have to interact with product class directly.and its loosely coupled with Prodfuct.
Client doesn't need to worry about the how implementation is happening. It just class factory to get the clasess.
