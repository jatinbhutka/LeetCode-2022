## System Requirements:

CRUD Events

```diff
+ * See Evenet (View all event by day, week, month, years)
    * Share Events
+ * Book an event: 
+   * Time Range (Start Time, End Time)
+   * Invite meating to guest
+   * Description
    * Google Meet Link
    * Title
    * Color
    * Notification settings
    * Guest reply (RSVP)
    * Overriding event for bookinhg
  * Set Reminder (Whole day reminder)
+ * Cancel an event
+ * Update an event
  * Event setting based on priority
+ * Recursive events  
```
 
## Use Case:

* There are two major part of system. User and Events both of them are dependent on each other
  * User
  * Events

```diff
- * Users Actions: The user will be responsible for the following operations (CRUD):
    * Book an event:
        * bookEvent(eventTitle, description, invite....) ---> This function willl return an event
    * see an event
        * getEvent(eventID, userID....)
    * update an event
        * updateEvent (eventID, params...) ----> Update event
    * cancel an event
        * cancelEvent(eventID) ----> SuccessMessgae
    * get event Info:
        * getEventInfo(eventID)
 ```

* In the Guest list user (Creator) will be always added to the event.
* We can use **CRON JOB** for to setup recurssing events

Note: 
* We can add validation for invitees, mutliple booking for same slot etc..
* We can set type of ID. eg. Reminder, events


## Class Diagram:

Users:
* ID
* NameOfUser
* list <events>
  
  Below are the method for users:
- bookEvent(event) ---> SuccessMessage
- cancelEvent(id). ---> 200 response
- updateEvents(id, event) ---> HTTP Codee, 200 OK
- getEvents(startTime, endTime) ---> Return list the events
  
  
Events:
  
* ID - STring
* StartTime - date
* endTime - date
* recurringFreq - date
* recurringEndTime - date
* dsecriptin - str
* guestList - list<users>
* creater - user
  
  No Methods for events

  


It is importat to have user-all events, events-users to optimize performance because the most importat feature is user open  calender, user need to see all his/her events.
* User - his/her all events
* Event - 
  
  
  
Note: Recuring Event update for one/all recuring event it will be complecated.

* How will you store all recuring events? With Same eventID or it will have different eventID? 
  
* So, We will consider all recuring event seperatly.
  
* Capacity wise can we do it seperatly?:
  
   * 50 years * 365 days * 3 events * 1 Billion user == # 50 Trillio events
  
   * Each event will be of few byts, which 50 PB
  
* You can always stop spam user that are spamming your website.

  

Requirement for recurring events:
* Treat every event as separetely
* List of events

```diff  
- Lets Write the code... 
  

How will we write all 4 methods/APIs?  
*  
  
# One Approch: When reminder inherance properties from event class. Think about does reminder is event?
  
  Diff in properties of event v/s reminder?
  - event has link
  - reminder doesn't have link
  
  class Events:
    def __init__(self,....):
      pass
  
  class Reminder (Events):
    def __init__(self,...):
      pass
  
  class Reminder (Events):
      def __init__(self,....):
      pass
  
  
  
  
  * viewEvent(eventID, userID....)
      * We will sort eventID by StartTime
      * map <user, TreeSet<eventID>>
  
  we will use eventManager class to manage events
