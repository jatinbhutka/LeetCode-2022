# Object oriented Basic concepts:

## Class:

## Object:

## Inheritance:

Whatever you parent has, that will be yours. and you thing is also yours.

```python
class A:
    def feature1(self):
        print("Feature 1 working")

    def feature2(self):
        print("Feature 2 working")

class B:
    def feature3(self):
        print("Feature 3 working")

    def feature4(self):
        print("Feature 4 working")

# Class C is child (Sub) class and its inheriting properties of class A, class B (Parent or Super).
# Child can access parent, grant parent super grant parent properties.

class C(A,B):
    def feature5(self):
        print("Feature 5 working")


a1 = A()

a1.feature1()
a1.feature2()

b1 = B()

c1 = C()
```


## Encapsulation:
* Its usufull when you want to protect your data. Particularly when you want to give your code to some other.
* To Encapsulate, ***we create function like setMethod, getMethod...**
* But Still we can set speed by using object.speed = 400, We need to prevent this type of setting of data. We need to make object prperties **private** using double _ infront of our variable

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, speed, color):
        self.__speed = speed
        self.__color = color

    def set_speed(self, value):
        self.__speed = value

    def get_speed(self):
        return self.__speed


    def set_color(self, value):
        self.__color = value

    def get_color(self):
        return self.__color

ford = Car(200, 'red')
honda = Car(250, 'blue')
audi = Car(300, 'black')

ford.set_speed(300)
print(ford.get_speed())
print(ford.get_color())
```

## Abstraction: Python Directly don't support Abstraction but you can use ABC module for abstraction

Abstract Method: The method That don;t have body we call it as abstract method

What is Abstract Class: Classes that have abstract method is call abstract class


Use of Abstract Class - a process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user. 

```python
# Abstract Class - For making class abstract we need to import abs method (from abc import ABC, abstractmethod)

class Computer(ABC):
  # Abstract Method
  @abstractmethod
  def process(self):
    pass
```

## Polymorphism: (many - forms)

## Method Overloading:

```python
                      (---Method Overloading---)

 class Student:

     def __init__(self,m1,m2):
         self.m1 = m1
         self.m2 = m2

     def sum(self,a=None,b=None,c=None):
         s = 0
         if a!=None and b!=None and c!=None:
           s = a+b+c
         elif a!=None and b!=None:
             s = a+b
         else:
             s = a
         return s

 s1 = Student(58,69)
 print(s1.sum(5))
```

## Method Overridding:
It will search for method in given class then search for parent class.

```python
                        (---Method Overriding---)

class A:

    def show(self):
        print("in A Show")

class B(A):

    def show(self):
        print("in B Show")

a1 = B()
a1.show()
```
