# Design Vending machine:

Note:
* VM is generally operated by itself. Its design in a such a way that its different from any other system where it doesnt used by distributed system or have concurrent millions of user. Like for any other distributed system

* It will be used by one person at a time, may be few thosands user a day.


Requirements for VM:
1. **Ability to select an item**
2. **Ability to pay for an Item (Cash or Card)**
3. **Dispense the item**
4. Notify the owener(admin) about the inventory item. (Any Item is low on stock, notify owener or service agent)


Let me go over Flow Diagram:

Below is typical life cycle, You can add more option like cancelling/ removing item etc..

System Diagram:

There will be below main component,
* Users
* Item Selection - This will have mapping of Item to number. Its 2D matrix where every row have certain item associated with it. So, when user select number our system know which item is selected 
* Payment system (Cash) 
  * Calculate Money Paid - User has paid correct amount of money, 
  * Dispense Change: if more > return extra money. Also System should be aware of fraud as well
  * System should be take care of Fraud as well. System should verify coin or card before dispensing to stop Fraud.
* Dispensing of Items: When Item is selected and payment is successfull our system should be able to perform Mechanical movement to dispense correct Item.

Steps: When Item is in Stock
- When User I/p Location of Item: Row and Col combination.
- Item Selectiojn will know which Item is selected and corresponding Price of Item.
- Item Selection system gives total amount of price to Payment System which essentially calculate total money 
- Payment system then calculate money paid to system and if require dispense the change to the user
- Once its done, It send notification to dispensing system, which will dispense the item to the user.

Steps: When Item is not in Stock
- Ideally I think user can see from Glass itself whether item is in stock or not but even after knowing user keyin some number.
- Item Selection will have stock of the item as well. So, if item not in stock it will basically return Out of stock msg to user.


Steps: What if user doesn't i/p right amount of money?
- Payment system know the minimum amount of payment it should get.
- From Item selection, when user move to Payment system there will be some timer until then user have to pay the minimum amount of money if not payment system will cancel the transaction and  dispense all the money to user and move back to ready state.


Steps: What if user over Pays money?
- Calculate Money Paid will calculate the money (Coin + Notes)
- Calculate Money Paid will calculate the diff (What need to dispense)
- Along with it, it will calculate combination of coin+notes, need to be dispense out to users.
- Gives notification of payment system to dispense Coin + Notes.

Steps: What if user over Pays money and system can not give change of diff amount to user?

* Two Option:
 * System can cancel the transaction and give all the money to the users without dispensing item to user
 * System can ask user to provide diff denomation of currency so that it can recalculate diff
 * Or It can ask user to remove one of the item from selected item

If Payment have Credi card option?

- System should be connected to Payment Gateway (Internet)
- Payment system should be able to read card and take moeny.
