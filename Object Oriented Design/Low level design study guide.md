# What to study for the Low Level System Design interviews or Object Oriented System Design interviews?

# 1. Object Oriented Programming Concepts:

The first step in your preparation should be mastering the concepts of OOPs (Object Oriented Programming). It is something which all freshers as well as experienced software developers must know. This includes topics like

* Classes
* Objects
* Inheritance
* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Polymorphism

There are deep-dives you can make into each of these topics as well, like how, for instance, in polymorphism we must know things like:

* What is compile time?
* What is run time?
* What is method over loading?
* What is method over writing?
 

You should be thorough with these concepts **since system design is extremely subjective and when you’re going to design their classes or discuss the same with the interviewer, you should be able to use the appropriate terms for the concept you’re explaining . Imagine an interviewer asks you whether you will keep specific data together or separate? You should be able to use terms like Encapsulation or Abstraction when telling the interviewer about your thought process, and use these concepts in your discussion.**

# Design Patterns:

Most common and important design patterns are,
* Factory, 
* Abstract Factory, 
* Singleton and 
* Observer.

* Common Example:
  * Hotem Management
  * Car Parking System
  * Elevator Management
  * Tic Tac Toe Game design
  * Ticket Booking System
  * Vending Machin
  * ATM
  
  Note: while Doing this solution, Think about all the topics where SOLID principal is used, Class Diag. looks,  Reln between classes,
