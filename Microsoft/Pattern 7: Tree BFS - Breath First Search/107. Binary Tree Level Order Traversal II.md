# 107. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II:

Given the root of a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

```
Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[15,7],[9,20],[3]]
```
```
Example 2:
Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]
```
```
Example 3:
Input: root = []
Output: []
```
```
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
```

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

# Complexity Analysis:

### Time complexity: O(N) since each node is processed exactly once.
### Space complexity: O(N) to keep the output structure which contains N node values.

#### Time complexity:
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N), where ‘N’ is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.

#### Space complexity:
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) as we need to return a list containing the level order traversal. We will also need O(N) space for the queue. Since we can have a maximum of N/2 nodes at any level (this could happen only at the lowest level), therefore we will need O(N) space to store them in the queue.
