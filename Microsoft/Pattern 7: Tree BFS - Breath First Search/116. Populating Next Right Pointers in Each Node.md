# Complexity Analysis:

#### Time Complexity: O(N)
since we process each node exactly once. Note that processing a node in this context means popping the node from the queue and then establishing the next pointers.

#### Space Complexity: O(N). 
This is a perfect binary tree which means the last level contains N/2N/2 nodes. The space complexity for breadth first traversal is the space occupied by the queue which is dependent upon the maximum number of nodes in particular level. So, in this case, the space complexity would be O(N)O(N).

# Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity: O(N) since we process each node exactly once.

### Space Complexity: O(1) since we don't make use of any additional data structure for traversing nodes on a particular level like the previous approach does.
