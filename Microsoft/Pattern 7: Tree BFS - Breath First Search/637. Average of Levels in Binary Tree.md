# 637. Average of Levels in Binary Tree:

Given the root of a binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

```
Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]
Explanation: The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3, on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11.
Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].
```

```
Example 2:
Input: root = [3,9,20,15,7]
Output: [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]
``` 
```
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1
```

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

    def averageOfLevels(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[float]:
        if root is None:
            return []
        
        queue = [root]

                if root.right:
                    next_queue.append(root.right)    
                
            levelAvg = LevelSum/LevelLength
            
            result.append(levelAvg)
            
            queue = next_queue
            next_queue = []
        return result
```


```python

      currentNode = queue.popleft()
      # add the node's value to the running sum
      levelSum += currentNode.val
      # insert the children of current node to the queue
      if currentNode.left:
        queue.append(currentNode.left)
      if currentNode.right:
        queue.append(currentNode.right)

    # append the current level's average to the result array
    result.append(levelSum / levelSize)

  return result


def main():
  root = TreeNode(12)
  root.left = TreeNode(7)
  root.right = TreeNode(1)
  root.left.left = TreeNode(9)
  root.left.right = TreeNode(2)
  root.right.left = TreeNode(10)
  root.right.right = TreeNode(5)
  print("Level averages are: " + str(find_level_averages(root)))


main()

```

### Time complexity:
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N) where ‘N’ is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.

### Space complexity:
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) which is required for the queue. Since we can have a maximum of N/2 nodes at any level (this could happen only at the lowest level), therefore we will need O(N) space to store them in the queue.
