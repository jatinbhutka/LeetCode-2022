# 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree:

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
```
Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2
```
```
Example 2:
Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5
```
 
```
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 105].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
```


##### Method 1 : BFS Iterative approach 
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if root is None:
            return 0
        
        minDepth = 1
        queue = [root]
        next_queue = []
        
        while len(queue) > 0:
            for root in queue:
                if root.left is None and root.right is None:
                    return minDepth
                if root.left:
                    next_queue.append(root.left)
                if root.right:
                    next_queue.append(root.right)
            minDepth += 1
            queue = next_queue
            next_queue = []
```

# Method 2: DFS
```python
class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not root:
            return 0
        else:
            stack, min_depth = [(1, root),], float('inf')
        
        while stack:
            depth, root = stack.pop()
            children = [root.left, root.right]
            if not any(children):
                min_depth = min(depth, min_depth)
            for c in children:
                if c:
                    stack.append((depth + 1, c))
        
        return min_depth 
```

# Method 3: recursive
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not root: 
            return 0 
        
        children = [root.left, root.right]
        # if we're at leaf node
        if not any(children):
            return 1
        
        min_depth = float('inf')
        for c in children:
            if c:
                min_depth = min(self.minDepth(c), min_depth)
        return min_depth + 1 
```

# Complexity analysis:

#### Time complexity : in the worst case for a balanced tree we need to visit all nodes level by level up to the tree height, that excludes the bottom level only. This way we visit N/2N/2 nodes, and thus the time complexity is \mathcal{O}(N)O(N).

#### Space complexity : is the same as time complexity here \mathcal{O}(N)O(N).
