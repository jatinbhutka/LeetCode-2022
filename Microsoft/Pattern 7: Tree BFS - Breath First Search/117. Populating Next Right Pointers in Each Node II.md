# Complexity Analysis:

### Time Complexity: O(N)
since we process each node exactly once. Note that processing a node in this context means popping the node from the queue and then establishing the next pointers.

### Space Complexity: O(N). This is a perfect binary tree which means the last level contains N/2N/2 nodes. The space complexity for breadth first traversal is the maximum space occupied and the space occupied by the queue is dependent upon the maximum number of nodes in particular level. So, in this case, the space complexity would be O(N)O(N).



# Approach 2: Using previously established next pointers

```python
class Solution:
    
    def processChild(self, childNode, prev, leftmost):
        if childNode:
            
            # If the "prev" pointer is alread set i.e. if we
            # already found atleast one node on the next level,
            # setup its next pointer
            if prev:
                prev.next = childNode
            else:    
                # Else it means this child node is the first node
                # we have encountered on the next level, so, we
                # set the leftmost pointer
                leftmost = childNode
            prev = childNode 
        return prev, leftmost
    
    def connect(self, root: Optional['Node']) -> Optional['Node']:
        
        if not root:
            return root
        
        # The root node is the only node on the first level
        # and hence its the leftmost node for that level
        leftmost = root
        
        # We have no idea about the structure of the tree,
        # so, we keep going until we do find the last level.
        # The nodes on the last level won't have any children
        while leftmost:
            
            # "prev" tracks the latest node on the "next" level
            # while "curr" tracks the latest node on the current
            # level.
            prev, curr = None, leftmost
            
            # We reset this so that we can re-assign it to the leftmost
            # node of the next level. Also, if there isn't one, this
            # would help break us out of the outermost loop.
            leftmost = None
            
            # Iterate on the nodes in the current level using
            # the next pointers already established.
            while curr:
                
                # Process both the children and update the prev
                # and leftmost pointers as necessary.
                prev, leftmost = self.processChild(curr.left, prev, leftmost)
                prev, leftmost = self.processChild(curr.right, prev, leftmost)
                
                # Move onto the next node.
                curr = curr.next
                
        return root 
```


# Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity: O(N) since we process each node exactly once.
#### Space Complexity: O(1) since we don't make use of any additional data structure for traversing nodes on a particular level like the previous approach does.
