```python
class Solution:
    def accountsMerge(self, accounts: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:

        # Account 
        #   - accounts[i][0] is a name
        #   - Rest of elements are emails

        # This seems like Graph Problem. 
        # Name are connected via same email id   

        ## DFS Will give all the possible connections
        ##      - Maintain Visited set, so we don't end up in infinite loop
        ###     - Node - Email

# Time: O(N * K) * O(N Log K) ====> O(N * K * N Log K)
# N - No. of accounts, k = max no. of emails per user
#   - We need to visit all the email in DFS
#   - All email are part of one account
#   - We are sorting here

# Space: O(N * K)
