read4(buf) # read4 returns 4. Now buf = ['a','b','c','d'], fp points to 'e'
read4(buf) # read4 returns 4. Now buf = ['e','f','g','h'], fp points to 'i'
read4(buf) # read4 returns 3. Now buf = ['i','j','k',...], fp points to end of file

        ## RC ##
        ## APPROACH : BUFFER READING ##
        ## 1. dont get confused with question description, our final buf will have min( n, all the characters that are in file)
        ## 2. At any point buf4, will maximum of 4 characters or count returned from the read4.
        ## 3. As I can read utmost 4 chars at a time, I create an array of size 4 and pass it to the function read4(buf4). That read4 function will fill my buf4 and returns the count how many characters it filled.
        ## 4. I take those buf4 chars filled and append it to my final buf.
        
        buf4 = [''] * 4         
        read = 0
        while read < n: 
            count = read4(buf4)   
            # Read file into buf4 && count -> num of chars in buf4
            if not count: 
                print(count)
                break             # no of chars to read, EOF
            count = min(count, n - read)    # if n = 5 and file size is 8, in second read you have to take only n-read i.e 5-4 = 1
            buf[read:read+count] = buf4[:count]       # Copy from buf4 to buf.
            read += count
        return read                         # we have return total num of characters read
```

# Complexity Analysis

#### Time complexity: O(N) to copy N characters.
#### Space complexity: O(1) to keep buf4 of 4 elements.
