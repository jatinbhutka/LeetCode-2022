# 113. Path Sum II:

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of the node values in the path equals targetSum. Each path should be returned as a list of the node values, not node references.

A root-to-leaf path is a path starting from the root and ending at any leaf node. A leaf is a node with no children.

### Method : Recursion
=======================

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def pathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> List[List[int]]:            
        
        def allPathSum(currentNode, targetSum, allPath, currentPath):
            if currentNode is None:
                return

            currentPath.append(currentNode.val)
            if currentNode.left is None and currentNode.right is None and targetSum == currentNode.val:
                allPath.append(list(currentPath))
            else:
                allPathSum(currentNode.left, targetSum - currentNode.val, allPath, currentPath)
                allPathSum(currentNode.right, targetSum - currentNode.val, allPath, currentPath)
            del currentPath[-1]
                
        allPath = []
        allPathSum(root, targetSum, allPath, [])
        return allPath
```

#### Time complexity: O(N^2)
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N^2) where ‘N’ is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once (which will take O(N) and for every leaf node, we might have to store its path (by making a copy of the current path) which will take O(N)

#### Space complexity: O(N)
If we ignore the space required for the allPaths list, the space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) in the worst case. This space will be used to store the recursion stack. The worst-case will happen when the given tree is a linked list (i.e., every node has only one child).
