# Recursive:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def sumNumbers(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        def findSum (root, pathSum):
            if root is None:
                return 0
            
            pathSum = 10 * pathSum + root.val
            
            if root.left is None and root.right is None:
                return pathSum
            return findSum(root.left, pathSum) + findSum(root.right, pathSum)
        
        return findSum(root, 0)    
```
#### Time complexity: O(N), since one has to visit each node.
#### Space complexity: O(H), to keep the recursion stack, where H is a tree height.

# Iterative Method:
```python
class Solution:
    def sumNumbers(self, root: TreeNode):
        root_to_leaf = 0
        stack = [(root, 0) ]
        
        while stack:
            root, curr_number = stack.pop()
            if root is not None:
                curr_number = curr_number * 10 + root.val
                # if it's a leaf, update root-to-leaf sum
                if root.left is None and root.right is None:
                    root_to_leaf += curr_number
                else:
                    stack.append((root.right, curr_number))
                    stack.append((root.left, curr_number))
                        
        return root_to_leaf
```

# Recursive:
```python
class Solution:
    def sumNumbers(self, root: TreeNode):
        def preorder(r, curr_number):
            nonlocal root_to_leaf
            if r:
                curr_number = curr_number * 10 + r.val
                # if it's a leaf, update root-to-leaf sum
                if not (r.left or r.right):
                    root_to_leaf += curr_number
                    
                preorder(r.left, curr_number)
                preorder(r.right, curr_number) 
        
        root_to_leaf = 0
        preorder(root, 0)
        return root_to_leaf
```


#### Time complexity: O(N), since one has to visit each node.
#### Space complexity: O(H), to keep the recursion stack, where H is a tree height.

The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) in the worst case. This space will be used to store the recursion stack. The worst case will happen when the given tree is a linked list (i.e., every node has only one child).
