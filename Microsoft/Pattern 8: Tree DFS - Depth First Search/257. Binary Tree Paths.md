# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def binaryTreePaths(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[str]:
        
        def findAllPath(root, allPath, currentPath):
            if root is None:
                return
            
            currentPath.append(root.val)

            if root.left is None and root.right is None:
                Path = "->".join(str(x) for x in currentPath)  
                allPath.append(Path)
            else:
                findAllPath(root.left, allPath, currentPath)
                findAllPath(root.right, allPath, currentPath)
            del currentPath[-1]
        
        allPath = []
        findAllPath(root, allPath, [])
        return allPath

#### Time complexity:
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N^2) where ‘N’ is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once (which will take O(N), and for every leaf node, we might have to store its path (by making a copy of the current path) which will take O(N) We can calculate a tighter time complexity of O(NlogN) from the space complexity discussion below.

#### Space complexity:
If we ignore the space required for the allPaths list, the space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) in the worst case. This space will be used to store the recursion stack. The worst-case will happen when the given tree is a linked list (i.e., every node has only one child).


# Methode 2: Recursion
```python
class Solution:
    def binaryTreePaths(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        def construct_paths(root, path):
            if root:
                path += str(root.val)
                if not root.left and not root.right:  # if reach a leaf
                    paths.append(path)  # update paths  
                else:
                    path += '->'  # extend the current path
                    construct_paths(root.left, path)
                    construct_paths(root.right, path)

        paths = []
        construct_paths(root, '')
        return paths
```

#### Time complexity : O(N)
we visit each node exactly once, thus the time complexity is O(N), where NN is the number of nodes.

#### Space complexity : O(N). 
Here we use the space for a stack call and for a paths list to store the answer. paths contains as many elements as leafs in the tree and hence couldn't be larger than  NlogN for the trees containing more than one element. Hence the space complexity is determined by a stack call. In the worst case, when the tree is completely unbalanced, e.g. each node has only one child node, the recursion call would occur NN times (the height of the tree), therefore the storage to keep the call stack would be O(N). But in the best case (the tree is balanced), the height of the tree would be log(N). Therefore, the space complexity in this case would be O(log(N)).

class Solution:
    def binaryTreePaths(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: List[str]
        """
        if not root:
            return []
        
        paths = []
        stack = [(root, str(root.val))]
        while stack:
            node, path = stack.pop()
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                paths.append(path)
            if node.left:
                stack.append((node.left, path + '->' + str(node.left.val)))
            if node.right:
                stack.append((node.right, path + '->' + str(node.right.val)))
        
        return paths
