# 112. Path Sum:


## Recursion:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def hasPathSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], targetSum: int) -> bool:
        if root is None:
            return False
        
        if targetSum == root.val and root.left is None and root.right is None:
            return True
        
        return self.hasPathSum(root.left, targetSum - root.val) or self.hasPathSum(root.right, targetSum - root.val)
```

### Time complexity:
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N) where ‘N’ is the total number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the fact that we traverse each node once.

### Space complexity:
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) in the worst case. This space will be used to store the recursion stack. The worst case will happen when the given tree is a linked list (i.e., every node has only one child).

## Iteration:

```python
class Solution:
    def hasPathSum(self, root, sum):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type sum: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if not root:
            return False

        de = [(root, sum - root.val), ]
        while de:
            node, curr_sum = de.pop()
            if not node.left and not node.right and curr_sum == 0:  
                return True
            if node.right:
                de.append((node.right, curr_sum - node.right.val))
            if node.left:
                de.append((node.left, curr_sum - node.left.val))
        return False
```

# Complexity Analysis

### Time complexity : the same as the recursion approach O(N).
### Space complexity : O(N) since in the worst case, when the tree is completely unbalanced, e.g. each node has only one child node, we would keep all N nodes in the stack. But in the best case (the tree is balanced), the height of the tree would be log(N). Therefore, the space complexity in this case would be O(log(N)).
