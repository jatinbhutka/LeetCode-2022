Let N be the board length, which is 9 in this question. Note that since the value of N is fixed, the time and space complexity of this algorithm can be interpreted as O(1). However, to better compare each of the presented approaches, we will treat N as an arbitrary value in the complexity analysis below.

#### Time complexity: O(N ^ 2) 
because we need to traverse every position in the board, and each of the four check steps is an O(1)O(1) operation.

#### Space complexity: O(N ^ 2)
because we need to create 3N arrays each with size N to store all previously seen numbers for all rows, columns, and boxes.
