class Solution:
    def removeOnes(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        
        
        
        # Basically the "pattern" of each row should be the same, by pattern, I mean following:
            # 001100 and 001100 are the same pattern
            # 001100 and 110011 (the invert of original) are the same pattern
        # Only in above situation, one matrix can be converted to all zero
        
        
        # We need to get the following properties first:

        # 1. For each row or col, we only need to flip it once or do not flip. (Flip 2, 4, 6,.. times is same as not flip; flip 1, 3, 5, .. times is same as flip once);
        # 2. The order of flipping does not matter.
        # 3. If after some flips, we can get the all-zero matrix. Then for each pair of rows (or cols), they must be exactly same (every element is the same) or completely different (every element is different).
        
        
        # Steps:
            # 1. Turn Row 1 in to zero
                # i. Any col of zeroth row has zero, then flip that col
            # 2. check rest of row have all zeros or all 1's

            rowSum = 0
            for colInd in range(COLS):
                rowSum += grid[rowInd][colInd] 
            #print(rowSum)
