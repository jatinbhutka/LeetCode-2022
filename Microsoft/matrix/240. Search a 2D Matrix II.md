```python
class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        
        rows = len(matrix)
        cols = len(matrix[0])
        
        if rows == 0 or cols == 0:
            return False
        
        r = 0
        c = cols - 1
        while r < rows and c >= 0:
            if target == matrix[r][c]:
                return True
            elif target > matrix[r][c]:
                r += 1
            elif target < matrix[r][c]:
                c -= 1
        return False
```


## Complexity Analysis:

#### Time complexity : O(n+m)

The key to the time complexity analysis is noticing that, on every iteration (during which we do not return true) either row or col is is decremented/incremented exactly once. Because row can only be decremented m times and col can only be incremented nn times before causing the while loop to terminate, the loop cannot run for more than n+m iterations. Because all other work is constant, the overall time complexity is linear in the sum of the dimensions of the matrix.

#### Space complexity : O(1)
Because this approach only manipulates a few pointers, its memory footprint is constant.
