# 143. Reorder List:

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
Reorder the list to be on the following form:

L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.


Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 104].
1 <= Node.val <= 1000

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify head in-place instead.
        """
        #Base Case:
        if head is None and head.next is None:
            return 

        # Reach out to end:
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
    
        # Reverse second half:
        prev = None
        curr = slow
        while curr is not None:
            temp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = temp

        seconf_half = prev
        first_half = head
        while seconf_half is not None and first_half is not None:
            tempF = first_half.next
            first_half.next = seconf_half
            first_half = tempF

            
            tempS = seconf_half.next
            seconf_half.next = first_half
            seconf_half = tempS
            
        if first_half is not None:
            first_half.next = None
```

# Complexity Analysis

## Time complexity: O(N). 
There are three steps here. To identify the middle node takes O(N) time. To reverse the second part of the list, one needs N/2 operations. The final step, to merge two lists, requires N/2 operations as well. In total, that results in O(N) time complexity.

## Space complexity: O(1)
Since we do not allocate any additional data structures.
