# 457. Circular Array Loop:

You are playing a game involving a circular array of non-zero integers nums. Each nums[i] denotes the number of indices forward/backward you must move if you are located at index i:

If nums[i] is positive, move nums[i] steps forward, and
If nums[i] is negative, move nums[i] steps backward.
Since the array is circular, you may assume that moving forward from the last element puts you on the first element, and moving backwards from the first element puts you on the last element.

A cycle in the array consists of a sequence of indices seq of length k where:

Following the movement rules above results in the repeating index sequence seq[0] -> seq[1] -> ... -> seq[k - 1] -> seq[0] -> ...
Every nums[seq[j]] is either all positive or all negative.
k > 1
Return true if there is a cycle in nums, or false otherwise.

 
```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,-1,1,2,2]
Output: true
Explanation:
There is a cycle from index 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 -> ...
The cycle's length is 3.
```
```
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,2]
Output: false
Explanation:
The sequence from index 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> ... is not a cycle because the sequence's length is 1.
By definition the sequence's length must be strictly greater than 1 to be a cycle.
```

```
Example 3:

Input: nums = [-2,1,-1,-2,-2]
Output: false
Explanation:
The sequence from index 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> ... is not a cycle because nums[1] is positive, but nums[2] is negative.
Every nums[seq[j]] must be either all positive or all negative.
 ```
```
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5000
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
nums[i] != 0
 ```

Follow up: Could you solve it in O(n) time complexity and O(1) extra space complexity?

# Time Complexity:
The above algorithm will have a time complexity of O(N^2) where ‘N’ is the number of elements in the array. This complexity is due to the fact that we are iterating all elements of the array and trying to find a cycle for each element.

# Space Complexity:
The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).

# An Alternate Approach:
In our algorithm, we don’t keep a record of all the numbers that have been evaluated for cycles. We know that all such numbers will not produce a cycle for any other instance as well. If we can remember all the numbers that have been visited, our algorithm will improve to O(N) as, then, each number will be evaluated for cycles only once. We can keep track of this by creating a separate array, however, in this case, the space complexity of our algorithm will increase to O(N).O(N).
