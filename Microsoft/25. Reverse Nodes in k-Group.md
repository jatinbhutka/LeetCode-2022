# 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

 
```
Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
```
```
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
 ```
```
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is n.
1 <= k <= n <= 5000
0 <= Node.val <= 1000
 ```

Follow-up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra memory space?

        temp = head
        while temp != None:
            temp = temp.next
            length += 1
        return length
    
    def reverseKGroupH(self, head, k, length):
        if length < k:
            return head
        
        count, nex, prev, curr = 0, None, None, head
        while count < k and curr != None:
            nex = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = nex
            count += 1
        
        if nex != None:
            head.next = self.reverseKGroupH(nex, k, length - k)
        return prev
    
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        length = self.lengthOfLinkedList(head)
        return self.reverseKGroupH(head, k, length)

```

# Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity: O(N) 

since we process each node exactly twice. Once when we are counting the number of nodes in each recursive call, and then once when we are actually reversing the sub-list. A slightly optimized implementation here could be that we don't count the number of nodes at all and simply reverse k nodes. If at any point we find that we didn't have enough nodes, we can re-reverse the last set of nodes so as to keep the original structure as required by the problem statement. That ways, we can get rid of the extra counting.

### Space Complexity: O(N/k) used up by the recursion stack. 

The number of recursion calls is determined by both kk and N. In every recursive call, we process kk nodes and then make a recursive call to process the rest.




# Iterative Way:

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:

        if k <= 1 or head is None:
            return head

        prev = dum = ListNode(-1)
        dum.next = head
        curr = head
        length = 0        
        while curr:
            length += 1
            curr = curr.next
        print(length)
        loop = length//k
        
        current, previous = head, None
        
        while loop:
            last_node_of_previous_part = previous
            # after reversing the LinkedList 'current' will become the last node of the sub-list
            last_node_of_sub_list = current
            next = None  # will be used to temporarily store the next node
            
            
            i = 0
            while current is not None and i < k:  # reverse 'k' nodes
                next = current.next
                current.next = previous
                previous = current
                current = next
                i += 1

        # connect with the previous part
            if last_node_of_previous_part is not None:
                last_node_of_previous_part.next = previous
            else:
                head = previous

        # connect with the next part
            last_node_of_sub_list.next = current

            if current is None:
                break
            previous = last_node_of_sub_list
            
            loop -= 1
        return head
