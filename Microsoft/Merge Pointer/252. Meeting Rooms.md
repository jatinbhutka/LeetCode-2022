# 252. Meeting Rooms

Given an array of meeting time intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], determine if a person could attend all meetings.

```
Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]
Output: false
```
```
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: true
 ```
```
Constraints:

0 <= intervals.length <= 104
intervals[i].length == 2
0 <= starti < endi <= 106
```

```python
class Solution:
    def canAttendMeetings(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        
        if len(intervals) <=1:
            return True
        
        intervals.sort(key = lambda x : x[0]  )
        
        start = intervals[0][0]
        end = intervals[0][1]
        
        for i in range(1,len(intervals)):
            interval = intervals[i]
            
            if interval[0] < end:
                return False
            start = interval[0]
            end = interval[1]
        return True
                
```


# Complexity Analysis

# Time complexity : O(N log N). 
The time complexity is dominated by sorting. Once the array has been sorted, only O(n)O(n) time is taken to go through the array and determine if there is any overlap.

# Space complexity : O(1).
Since no additional space is allocated.
