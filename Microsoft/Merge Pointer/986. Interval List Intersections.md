# 986. Interval List Intersections:

You are given two lists of closed intervals, firstList and secondList, where firstList[i] = [starti, endi] and secondList[j] = [startj, endj]. Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

A closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b.

The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].

 

Example 1:

```
Input: firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: firstList = [[1,3],[5,9]], secondList = []
Output: []
 
```

Constraints:
```
0 <= firstList.length, secondList.length <= 1000
firstList.length + secondList.length >= 1
0 <= starti < endi <= 109
endi < starti+1
0 <= startj < endj <= 109
endj < startj+1
```

```python
class Solution:
    def intervalIntersection(self, firstList: List[List[int]], secondList: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        if len(firstList) == 0 or len(secondList) == 0:
            return []
        
        res = []
        i = j = 0
        
        start = 0
        end = 1
        
        while i < len(firstList) and j < len(secondList) :           
            a_overlap_b = firstList[i][start] >=  secondList[j][start] and \
                          firstList[i][start] <= secondList[j][end]
            
            
            b_overlap_a = secondList[j][start] >=  firstList[i][start] and \
                          secondList[j][start] <= firstList[i][end]

            if (a_overlap_b or b_overlap_a):
                int_start = max(firstList[i][start],secondList[j][start])
                int_end = min(firstList[i][end],secondList[j][end])
                res.append([int_start, int_end])
                
            if firstList[i][end] < secondList[j][end]:
                i += 1
            else:
                j += 1
        return res

```

# Time complexity:
As we are iterating through both the lists once, the time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N + M), where ‘N’ and ‘M’ are the total number of intervals in the input arrays respectively.

# Space complexity:
Ignoring the space needed for the result list, the algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
