# 435. Non-overlapping Intervals:

Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping. 

```
Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
```
```
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
```
```
Example 3:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
``` 
```
Constraints:

1 <= intervals.length <= 105
intervals[i].length == 2
-5 * 104 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 104
```

# Solution:
```
eg. [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]] ----> [[1,2],[1,3], [2,3],[3,4],]

| 1 --- 2 ---- 3 ---- 4 |
  1 --- 2
  1 ---------- 3
        2 ---- 3
               3 ---- 4
               
# So, Here instead of sorting Interval by Start, it will be help to sort it by end. Because we will have to delete the largest interval (Max End)
