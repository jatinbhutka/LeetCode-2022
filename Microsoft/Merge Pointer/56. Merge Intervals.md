# 56. Merge Intervals:


Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.
 
```
Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
```
```
Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
 ```
```
Constraints:

1 <= intervals.length <= 104
intervals[i].length == 2
0 <= starti <= endi <= 104
```

```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        intervals.sort(key = lambda x: x[0])
        # print(intervals)
        
        MergeInterval = []
        start = intervals[0][0]
        end = intervals[0][1]
        
        for i in range(1,len(intervals)):
            interval = intervals[i]
            if interval[0] <= end:
                end = max(end, interval[1])
            else:
                MergeInterval.append([start, end])
                start = interval[0]
                end = interval[1]
        MergeInterval.append([start, end])
        return MergeInterval
            
```


# Time complexity:
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N * logN), where ‘N’ is the total number of intervals. We are iterating the intervals only once which will take O(N), in the beginning though, since we need to sort the intervals, our algorithm will take O(N * logN).

# Space complexity:
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) as we need to return a list containing all the merged intervals. We will also need O(N)O(N) space for sorting. For Java, depending on its version, Collections.sort() either uses Merge sort or Timsort, and both these algorithms need O(N) space. Overall, our algorithm has a space complexity of O(N).
