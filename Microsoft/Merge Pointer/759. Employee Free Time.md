# 759. Employee Free Time:

We are given a list schedule of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.

Each employee has a list of non-overlapping Intervals, and these intervals are in sorted order.

Return the list of finite intervals representing common, positive-length free time for all employees, also in sorted order.

(Even though we are representing Intervals in the form [x, y], the objects inside are Intervals, not lists or arrays. For example, schedule[0][0].start = 1, schedule[0][0].end = 2, and schedule[0][0][0] is not defined).  Also, we wouldn't include intervals like [5, 5] in our answer, as they have zero length.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]
Output: [[3,4]]
Explanation: There are a total of three employees, and all common
free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf].
We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.
```
```
Example 2:

Input: schedule = [[[1,3],[6,7]],[[2,4]],[[2,5],[9,12]]]
Output: [[5,6],[7,9]]
 ```
```
Constraints:

1 <= schedule.length , schedule[i].length <= 50
0 <= schedule[i].start < schedule[i].end <= 10^8
```

"""
# Definition for an Interval.

        self.start = start
        self.end = end

        # sort [] based on startTime
        intervals.sort(key = lambda x : x[0])

        result = []
        endTime = intervals[0][1]

            currStart = interval[0]
            if currStart > endTime:
                result.append(Interval(endTime, currStart))
            endTime = max(endTime, interval[1])
            
        # return result
        return result

# Time complexity:
The above algorithm’s time complexity is O(N*logK), where ‘N’ is the total number of intervals, and ‘K’ is the total number of employees. This is because we are iterating through the intervals only once (which will take O(N)), and every time we process an interval, we remove (and can insert) one interval in the Min Heap, (which will take O(logK)). At any time, the heap will not have more than ‘K’ elements.

# Space complexity:
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(K) as at any time, the heap will not have more than ‘K’ elements.
