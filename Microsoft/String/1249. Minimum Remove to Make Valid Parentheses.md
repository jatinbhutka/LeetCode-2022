- Convert string to list, because String is an immutable data structure in Python and it's much easier and memory-efficient to deal with a list for this task.

- Iterate through list

- Keep track of indices with open parentheses in the stack. In other words, when we come across open parenthesis we add an index to the stack.

- When we come across close parenthesis we pop an element from the stack. If the stack is empty we replace current list element with an empty string

- After iteration, we replace all indices we have in the stack with empty strings, because we don't have close parentheses for them.

- Convert list to string and return

```python
class Solution:
    def minRemoveToMakeValid(self, s: str) -> str:
        openB = '('
        closeB = ')'
        
        s = list(s)
        stack = []
        
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == openB:
                stack.append(i)
            elif s[i] == closeB:
                if stack != [] :
                    stack.pop()
                else:
                    s[i]=""

        for i in stack:
            s[i] = ""
        return "".join(s)
        
```

```python
class Solution:
    def minRemoveToMakeValid(self, s: str) -> str:
        s = list(s)
        stack = []
        for i, char in enumerate(s):
            if char == '(':
                stack.append(i)
            elif char == ')':
                if stack:
                    stack.pop()
                else:
                    s[i] = ''
        while stack:
            s[stack.pop()] = ''
        return ''.join(s)
