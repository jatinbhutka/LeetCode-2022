```python
class Solution:
    def minDeletions(self, s: str) -> int:
        
        charFreq = {}
        for ch in s:
            if ch not in charFreq:
                charFreq[ch] = 0
            charFreq[ch] += 1
            
        # O(N)
            
            
            
        # O(26 * N)
        result = 0
        UniqSet = set()
        for ch, freq in charFreq.items():
            
            while freq in UniqSet and freq > 0:
                freq -= 1
                result += 1
                
            UniqSet.add(freq)
            
        return result
```

#### Note: 
For this problem, we are given that the string will have only lowercase English letters and hence K = 26. Since, for this problem, 10^5≤N≤10^5
we could consider each of the above approaches to have time complexity as approximately O(N) and space complexity as approximately O(1).


```python
class Solution:
    def minDeletions(self, s: str) -> int:
        
        # Store the frequency of each character
        frequency = [0] * 26
        for char in s:
            frequency[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
        frequency.sort(reverse=True)
        
        delete_count = 0
        # Maximum frequency the current character can have
        max_freq_allowed = len(s)
        
        # Iterate over the frequencies in descending order
        for freq in frequency:
            # Delete characters to make the frequency equal the maximum frequency allowed
            if freq > max_freq_allowed:
                delete_count += freq - max_freq_allowed
                freq = max_freq_allowed

            # Update the maximum allowed frequency
            max_freq_allowed = max(0, freq - 1)
            
        return delete_count
```

# Complexity Analysis

Here, N is the length of the given string, and KK is the maximum possible number of distinct characters in s.

### Time complexity: O(N + K logK)

To calculate the frequency of each character, we need to traverse the string which will take O(N)O(N) time. Note that in this approach, we are sorting the frequencies (not the characters), and there will only be KK frequencies. Hence the time required for sorting will be O(K \log K)O(KlogK). Thus, the time complexity equals O(N+KlogK).

### Space complexity: O(K)

We need KK indices in the list frequency to store the frequency. Some space will be used for sorting the list frequency. The space complexity of the sorting algorithm depends on the implementation of each programming language. For instance, in Java, the Arrays.sort() for primitives is implemented as a variant of quicksort algorithm whose space complexity is O(\log K)O(logK). In C++ sort() function provided by STL is a hybrid of Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort and has a worst-case space complexity of O(\log K)O(logK). Thus, the use of the inbuilt sort() function might add up to O(\log K)O(logK) to space complexity. Hence, the space complexity is equal to O(K)
