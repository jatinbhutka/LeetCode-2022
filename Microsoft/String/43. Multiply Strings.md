# Below is not allowed:
```python
class Solution:
    def multiply(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        return str(int(num1) * int(num2))
```

# WithOut Using Str or int Method:
```python
class Solution:
    def multiply(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:

        if num1 == '0' or num2 == '0':
            return '0'
        
        result = [0 for _ in range(len(num1) + len(num2))]
        #print(result)
        
        num1 = num1[::-1]
        num2 = num2[::-1]
        
        # 1 ---> pointer to num1
        for i in range(len(num1)):
            
            # j ---> pointer to num2
            for j in range(len(num2)):
                
                multi = int(num1[i]) * int(num2[j])
                
                result[i + j] += multi
                result[i+j+1] += result[i + j] //10
                result[i + j] = result[i + j] % 10

        result = result[::-1]                
        beg = 0
        while result[beg] == 0:
            beg += 1
            
        result = result[beg:]
        
        i = 0
        while i < len(result):
            result[i] = str(result[i])
            i += 1

        return ''.join(result)
```

## Complexity Analysis

Here N and M are the number of digits in num1 and num2 respectively.

#### Time complexity: O(M⋅N).

During multiplication, we perform N operations for each of the M digits of the second number, so we need M \cdot NM⋅N time for it.

#### Space complexity: O(M + N)

The space used to store the output is not included in the space complexity. However, because strings are immutable in Python, Java, and Javascript, a temporary data structure, using O(M + N)space, is required to store the answer while it is updated.

On the other hand, in C++, strings are mutable, so we do not need a temporary data structure to store answer and can update answer directly. Thus, the C++ approach is a constant space solution.
