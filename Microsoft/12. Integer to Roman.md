# Complexity Analysis

#### Time complexity : O(1)

As there is a finite set of roman numerals, there is a hard upper limit on how many times the loop can iterate. This upper limit is 15 times, and it occurs for the number 3888, which has a representation of MMMDCCCLXXXVIII. Therefore, we say the time complexity is constant, i.e. O(1)O(1).

#### Space complexity : O(1)

The amount of memory used does not change with the size of the input integer, and is therefore constant.
