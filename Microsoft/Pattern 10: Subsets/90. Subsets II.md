```python
class Solution:
    def subsetsWithDup(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        list.sort(nums)
        result = []
        result.append([])
        
        startIndex, endIndex = 0, 0
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            startIndex = 0
            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
                startIndex = endIndex + 1
            endIndex = len(result) - 1
            
            for j in range(startIndex, endIndex+1):
                set1 = list(result[j])
                set1.append(nums[i])
                result.append(set1)
        return result
```

Time complexity: O(N * 2^N)
Since, in each step, the number of subsets doubles as we add each element to all the existing subsets, therefore, we will have a total of O(2^N) subsets, where ‘N’ is the total number of elements in the input set. And since we construct a new subset from an existing set, therefore, the time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N*2^N)

Space complexity: O(N * 2^N)
All the additional space used by our algorithm is for the output list. Since we will have a total of O(2^N) subsets, and each subset can take up to O(N) space, therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm will be O(N*2^N)
