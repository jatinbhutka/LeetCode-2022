        subsets = [[]]
        # start by adding the empty subset

        for currentNumber in nums:

#### Time complexity: O(N * 2^N)
Since, in each step, the number of subsets doubles as we add each element to all the existing subsets, therefore, we will have a total of O(2^N) subsets, where ‘N’ is the total number of elements in the input set. And since we construct a new subset from an existing set, therefore, the time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N*2^N)

#### Space complexity: O(N * 2^N)
All the additional space used by our algorithm is for the output list. Since we will have a total of O(2^N) subsets, and each subset can take up to O(N) space, therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm will be O(N*2^N)
