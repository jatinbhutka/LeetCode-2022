```python
class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        subsets = [[]]
        # start by adding the empty subset

        for currentNumber in nums:
        
        # we will take all existing subsets and insert the current number in them to create new subsets
            n = len(subsets)
            for i in range(n):
                # create a new subset from the existing subset and insert the current element to it
                set1 = list(subsets[i])
                set1.append(currentNumber)
                subsets.append(set1)
                
        return subsets
```

#### Time complexity: O(N * 2^N)
Since, in each step, the number of subsets doubles as we add each element to all the existing subsets, therefore, we will have a total of O(2^N) subsets, where ‘N’ is the total number of elements in the input set. And since we construct a new subset from an existing set, therefore, the time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N*2^N)

#### Space complexity: O(N * 2^N)
All the additional space used by our algorithm is for the output list. Since we will have a total of O(2^N) subsets, and each subset can take up to O(N) space, therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm will be O(N*2^N)
