# 61. Rotate List:

Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.

 
```
Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
```
```
Example 2:
Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
Output: [2,0,1]
```

```
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 500].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
0<= k <= 2 * 109
```

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if head is None or head.next is None or k <= 0:
            return head    
        
        # Find Length of LinkedList
        length = 1
        curr = head
        while curr.next:
            length += 1
            curr = curr.next
        #print(curr.val, length)  
        
        curr.next = head
        
        rotation = k%length
#        print(rotation)
        i = 0
        while i < (length - rotation):
            i += 1
            curr = curr.next
            
#        print(curr.val)   
        head = curr.next
        curr.next = None
        return head
```


### Time complexity: O(N)
The time complexity of our algorithm will be O(N)
O(N) where ‘N’ is the total number of nodes in the LinkedList.

### Space complexity: O(1)
We only used constant space, therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm is O(1)
