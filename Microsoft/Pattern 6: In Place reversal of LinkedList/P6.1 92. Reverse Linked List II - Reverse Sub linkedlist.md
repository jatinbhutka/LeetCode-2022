# Solution:

The problem follows the In-place Reversal of a LinkedList pattern. We can use a similar approach as discussed in Reverse a LinkedList. Here are the steps we need to follow:

- Skip the first p-1 nodes, to reach the node at position p.
- Remember the node at position p-1 to be used later to connect with the reversed sub-list.
- Next, reverse the nodes from p to q using the same approach discussed in Reverse a LinkedList.
- Connect the p-1 and q+1 nodes to the reversed sub-list.

```python
from __future__ import print_function


class Node:
  def __init__(self, value, next=None):
    self.value = value
    self.next = next

  def print_list(self):
    temp = self
    while temp is not None:
      print(temp.value, end=" ")
      temp = temp.next
    print()


def reverse_sub_list(head, p, q):
  if p == q:
    return head

  # after skipping 'p-1' nodes, current will point to 'p'th node
  current, previous = head, None
  i = 0
  while current is not None and i < p - 1:
    previous = current
    current = current.next
    i += 1

  # we are interested in three parts of the LinkedList, the part before index 'p',
  # the part between 'p' and 'q', and the part after index 'q'
  last_node_of_first_part = previous
  # after reversing the LinkedList 'current' will become the last node of the sub-list
  last_node_of_sub_list = current
  next = None  # will be used to temporarily store the next node

  i = 0
  # reverse nodes between 'p' and 'q'
  while current is not None and i < q - p + 1:
    next = current.next
    current.next = previous
    previous = current
    current = next
    i += 1

  # connect with the first part
  if last_node_of_first_part is not None:
    # 'previous' is now the first node of the sub-list
    last_node_of_first_part.next = previous
  # this means p == 1 i.e., we are changing the first node (head) of the LinkedList
  else:
    head = previous

  # connect with the last part
  last_node_of_sub_list.next = current
  return head


def main():
  head = Node(1)
  head.next = Node(2)
  head.next.next = Node(3)
  head.next.next.next = Node(4)
  head.next.next.next.next = Node(5)

  print("Nodes of original LinkedList are: ", end='')
  head.print_list()
  result = reverse_sub_list(head, 2, 4)
  print("Nodes of reversed LinkedList are: ", end='')
  result.print_list()


main()

```


# Time complexity:
The time complexity of our algorithm will be O(N) where ‘N’ is the total number of nodes in the LinkedList.

# Space complexity:
We only used constant space, therefore, the space complexity of our algorithm is O(1).
