# Merge K Sorted array into one sorted array:

```python
from heapq import *

def mergeSort (arr):
    n = len(arr)
    minHeap = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        heappush(minHeap, (arr[i][0], i, arr[i]))
    
    print(minHeap)
    
    result = []
    while len(minHeap) > 0:
        num, ind, arr = heappop(minHeap)
        result.append(num)
        
        if len(arr) > ind + 1:
            heappush(minHeap, (arr[ind+1], ind+1, arr))
        
    
    return result
    
    

input = [   [1, 3, 5, 7],
            [2, 4, 6, 8],
            [0, 9, 10, 11],
            [-100]

        ] 
        
print(mergeSort(input))
```

# Time: N * Log K
Since we’ll be going through all the elements of all arrays and will be removing/adding one element to the heap in each step, the time complexity of the above algorithm will be **O(N*logK)**, where ‘N’ is the total number of elements in all the ‘K’ input arrays.

# Space: O(N)
