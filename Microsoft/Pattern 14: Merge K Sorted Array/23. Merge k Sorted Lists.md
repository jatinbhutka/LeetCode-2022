```python
import heapq

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeKLists(self, lists) :
        
        minHeap = []

      # put the root of each list in the min heap
      #  print(lists[0])
        for root in lists:
            if root is not None:
                heappush(minHeap, (root.val, root))


        head = tail = None
        while minHeap:
            
            nodeVal, node = heappop(minHeap)
            if head is None:
                head = tail = node
            else:   
                tail.next = node
                tail = tail.next

            if node.next is not None:
                heappush(minHeap, (node.next.val, node.next ))
            
        return head
```

#### Time complexity: O(N∗logK)
Since we’ll be going through all the elements of all arrays and will be removing/adding one element to the heap in each step, the time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N*logK),, where ‘N’ is the total number of elements in all the ‘K’ input arrays.

#### Space complexity: O(K)
The space complexity will be O(K) because, at any time, our min-heap will be storing one number from all the ‘K’ input arrays.
