```python

        """
        :type matrix: List[List[int]]
        :type k: int

        minHeap = []
        for i in range(len(matrix)):
            heappush(minHeap, (matrix[i][0], 0, matrix[i]))
            
        numberCount = 0
        number = 0
        while len(minHeap) > 0:
            number, ind, lst = heappop(minHeap)
            
            numberCount += 1
            if numberCount == k:
                break
            
            if len(lst) > ind+1:
                heappush(minHeap, (lst[ind+1], ind+1, lst))

#### Time: O( min(K,N) + K ∗ logN)
First, we inserted at most ‘K’ or one element from each of the ‘N’ rows, which will take O(min(K, N)). Then we went through at most ‘K’ elements in the matrix and remove/add one element in the heap in each step. As we can’t have more than ‘N’ elements in the heap in any condition, therefore, the overall time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(min(K, N) + K*logN)

#### Space: O(N)
The space complexity will be O(N) because, in the worst case, our min-heap will be storing one number from each of the ‘N’ rows.
