        That being said, we can solve the problem in a divide-and-conquer manner, where we divide the original sequence of prices into two subsequences and then we calculate the maximum profit that we could gain from making a single transaction in each subsequence.

        The total profits would be the sum of profits from each subsequence. If we enumerate all possible divisions (or we could consider them as combinations of subsequences), we could find the maximum total profits among them, which is also the desired result of the problem.


        For a sequence of length NNN, we would have NNN possible divisions (including no division), each of the elements would be visited once in each division. As a result, the overall time complexity of this naive implementation would be (N^2)
2
