O(s) s is total seconds in given time interval, in this case 300.

Basic ideal is using buckets. 1 bucket for every second because we only need to keep the recent hits info for 300 seconds. hit[] array is wrapped around by mod operation. Each hit bucket is associated with times[] bucket which record current time. If it is not current time, it means it is 300s or 600s... ago and need to reset to 1.

```python
class HitCounter:

    def __init__(self):
        self.q = [(0,0)] * 300

    def hit(self, timestamp: int) -> None:
        id = timestamp % 300
        time, hit = self.q[id]
        if timestamp == time:
            self.q[id] = time, hit+1
        else:
            self.q[id] = timestamp, 1

    def getHits(self, timestamp: int) -> int:
        ans = 0
        for i in range(300):
            time, hit = self.q[i]
            if timestamp - time < 300:
                ans += hit
        return ans


# Your HitCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = HitCounter()
# obj.hit(timestamp)
# param_2 = obj.getHits(timestamp)
```

Super easy design O(1) hit()  

O(s) getHits() no fancy data structure is needed!
