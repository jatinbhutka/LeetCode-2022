# 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III:

Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.

```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
```
```
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
``` 
```
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
0 <= k <= nums.length
```

```python
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        ws = 0 
        max_len = 0
        freq = {1:0, 0:0}
        max_repeate = freq[0]
        
        for we in range(len(arr)):
            right = arr[we] 
            freq[right] += 1
            
            while (we - ws + 1) - freq[1] > k:
                left = arr[ws]
                freq[left] -= 1
                ws += 1
            
            max_len = max(max_len, we - ws + 1)
            
        return max_len
