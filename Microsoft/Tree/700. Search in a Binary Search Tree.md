You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer val.

Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals val and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return null.

Example 1:

Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2
Output: [2,1,3]

Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
Output: []
 

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 5000].
1 <= Node.val <= 107
root is a binary search tree.
1 <= val <= 107

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def searchBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], val: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if root is None:
            return
        
        curr = root
        while curr:
            if curr.val < val:
                curr = curr.right
            elif curr.val > val:
                curr = curr.left
            else:
                return curr
```



```python
class Solution(object):
    def searchBST(self, root, val):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type val: int
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        current_node = root
        while current_node != None:
            if current_node.val == val:
                return current_node
            elif current_node.val < val:
                current_node = current_node.right
            else:
                current_node = current_node.left
        return None
```

##### It's best to use iteration rather than recursion here, because iteration is O(1) space, whereas recursion is O(log-n) on average with a worst case of O(n) space due to Python not supporting tail calls (meaning that everything goes on the stack, and that could be a lot for a stringy tree).

Regardless of whether we use iteration or recursion, the time taken has a best case of O(1), if the node we're looking for was the root node, an average case of O(n-log-n) for a reasonably balanced tree, and a worst case of O(n) when the tree is long and stringy.

Don't forget to make sure the root node actually exists, and also be careful that your code handles the case of ONLY having a root node.



```python
class Solution(object):
    def searchBST(self, root, val):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :type val: int
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        if root is None:
            return
        if root.val == val:
            return root
        if root.val > val:
            return self.searchBST(root.left, val)
        else:
            return self.searchBST(root.right, val)
            
```


```python
class Solution:
    def searchBST(self, root, val):
        if root and val < root.val: 
            return self.searchBST(root.left, val)
        elif root and val > root.val: 
            return self.searchBST(root.right, val)
        return root
```
