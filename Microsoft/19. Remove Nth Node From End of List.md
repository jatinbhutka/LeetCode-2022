# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List



```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        length = 0
        
        dum = ListNode(-1)
        dum.next = head
        
        prev = dum
        curr = head
        while curr:
            length += 1
            prev = curr
            curr = curr.next
        #print(length)
        
        
        prev = dum
        curr = head
        i = 0
        while curr and i < (length - n):
            prev = curr
            curr = curr.next
            i += 1
        prev.next = curr.next
        
        return dum.next
```

# Complexity Analysis

### Time complexity : O(L) ---> Two Pass
The algorithm makes two traversal of the list, first to calculate list length LL and second to find the (L - n)(L−n) th node. There are 2L-n2L−n operations and time complexity is O(L)O(L).

### Space complexity : O(1)


```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
        dum = ListNode(-1)
        dum.next = head
        
        slow = fast = dum
        for _ in range(n):
            fast = fast.next
            
        while fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next
            
        slow.next = slow.next.next
        
        return dum.next
```
