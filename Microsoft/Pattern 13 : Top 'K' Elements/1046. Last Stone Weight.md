# Complexity Analysis

Let N be the length of stones.

#### Time complexity : O(N logN).
Converting an array into a Heap takes O(N) time (it isn't actually sorting; it's putting them into an order that allows us to get the maximums, each in O(logN) time).

Like before, the main loop iterates up to Nâˆ’1 times. This time however, it's doing up to three O(logN) operation each time; two removes, and an optional add. Like always, the three is an ignored constant. This means that we're doing N * log N) = O(NlogN) operations.

Space complexity : O(N)

In Python, converting a list to a heap is done in-place, requiring O(1)O(1) auxillary space, giving a total space complexity of O(1)O(1). Modifying the input has its pros and cons; it saves space, but it means that other functions can't use the same array.

In Java though, it's O(N)O(N) to create the PriorityQueue.

We could reduce the space complexity to O(1)O(1) by implementing our own iterative heapfiy, if needed.
