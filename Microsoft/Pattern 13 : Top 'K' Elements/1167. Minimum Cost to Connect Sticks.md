# Complexity Analysis:

Time complexity : O(N logN), where N is the length of the input array. Let's break it down:

Step 1) Adding N elements to the priority queue will be O(N logN). 
Step 2) We remove two of the smallest elements and then add one element to the priority queue until we are left with one element. Since each such operation will reduce one element from the priority queue, we will perform N-1Nâˆ’1 such operations. Now, we know that both add and remove operations take O(\log{N})O(logN) in priority queue, therefore, complexity of this step will be O(N\log{N})O(NlogN). 

#### Space complexity : O(N) since we will store NN elements in our priority queue.
