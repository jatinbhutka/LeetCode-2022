                if -freq > 1:
                    waiting.append((freq+1, task))
                
                k -= 1
            
            for freq, task in waiting:
                heappush(maxHeap, (freq, task))

            # Count Idea;

#### Time complexity: O(N ∗ logN)
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N*logN) where ‘N’ is the number of tasks. Our while loop will iterate once for each occurrence of the task in the input (i.e. ‘N’) and in each iteration we will remove a task from the heap which will take O(logN) time. Hence the overall time complexity of our algorithm is O(N*logN)

#### Space complexity: O(N)
The space complexity will be O(N), as in the worst case, we need to store all the ‘N’ tasks in the HashMap.
