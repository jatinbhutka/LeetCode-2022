```python
class Solution:
    def reorganizeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        
        freqMap = {}
        for ch in s:
            if ch not in freqMap:
                freqMap[ch] = 0
            freqMap[ch] += 1
        
        maxHeap = []
        for key, freq in freqMap.items():
            heappush(maxHeap, (-freq, key))
        
        result = []
        prevChar = None
        preCharFreq = 0
        while len(maxHeap) > 0:
            ch_freq, ch = heappop(maxHeap)         
            if prevChar is not None and -preCharFreq > 0:
                heappush(maxHeap, (preCharFreq, prevChar))
            result.append(ch)
            prevChar = ch
            preCharFreq = ch_freq + 1
            
        if len(result) == len(s):        
            return "".join(result)
        else:
            return ""
```

#### Time complexity: O(N * logN)
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(N*logN)  where ‘N’ is the number of characters in the input string.

#### Space complexity: O(N)
The space complexity will be O(N) as in the worst case, we need to store all the ‘N’ characters in the HashMap.
