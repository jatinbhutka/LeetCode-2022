# 1636. Sort Array by Increasing Frequency:

### Solution:
Use a Heap to sort by using a tuple consisting of the count, and the negative value of the key. The reason we use the negative values to sort the keys in decreasing order as we are implementing a min heap.

```python
class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        freqMap = {}
        for num in nums:
            if num not in freqMap:
                freqMap[num] = 0
            freqMap[num] += 1
            
        minHeap = []
        for key, freq in freqMap.items():
            heappush(minHeap, (freq, -key))
            
        result = []
        while len(minHeap) > 0:
            freq, key = heappop(minHeap)
            while freq > 0:
                result.append(-key)
                freq -= 1
        
        return result
```
