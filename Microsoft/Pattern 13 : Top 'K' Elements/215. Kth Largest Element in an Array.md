# Complexity Analysis

### Time complexity : O(N logk). 
It will take us O(logK) to extract the minimum number from the min-heap. So the overall time complexity of our algorithm will be O(K*logK+(N-K)*logK) since, first, we insert ‘K’ numbers in the heap and then iterate through the remaining numbers and at every step, in the worst case, we need to extract the minimum number and insert a new number in the heap. This algorithm is better than O(N*logN)

### Space complexity : O(k) to store the heap elements.
