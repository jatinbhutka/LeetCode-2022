# 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs:


Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

```
Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,1,4,3]
```
```
Example 2:
Input: head = []
Output: []
```
```
Example 3:
Input: head = [1]
Output: [1]
```
```
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 100
```

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def swapPairs(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
        if head is None or head.next is None:
            return head
        
        dum = ListNode(-1)
        dum.next = head
        
        prev = dum 
        curr = head
        
        while curr and curr.next:
            
            # Nodes to be swapped            
            firstNode = curr
            secondNode = curr.next
            
            temp = secondNode.next
            
            # Swapping            
            prev.next = secondNode
            secondNode.next = firstNode
            firstNode.next = temp

            # Reinitializing the head and prev_node for next swap            
            curr = temp
            prev = firstNode

        return dum.next
```

# Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity: O(N) where N is the size of the linked list.
### Space Complexity: O(N) stack space utilized for recursion.
