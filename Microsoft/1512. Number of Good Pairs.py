1512. Number of Good Pairs

Given an array of integers nums, return the number of good pairs.

A pair (i, j) is called good if nums[i] == nums[j] and i < j.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,1,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 good pairs (0,3), (0,4), (3,4), (2,5) 0-indexed.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: Each pair in the array are good.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100

            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] == nums[j]:
                    count+=1
        return count

# Time - O(N^2)
# Space - O(1)



# Solution 2: Using hash Table:

"""
Fundamental Math Concept (Combinations)
The "# of pairs" can be calculated by summing each value from range 0 to n-1, where n is the "# of times repeated". So the "# of pairs" for the 5 repeated values, would be 0+1+2+3+4 = 10.

Another way to think about it is:

Notice in the table below how the number of pairs increments by adding the previous "# of times repeated" to the previous "# of pairs."

For example: to get the "# of pairs" for 3 repeated values, you would add the previous "# of times repeated" (which is 2) with the previous "# of pairs" (which is 1). Therefore, the "# of pairs for 3 repeated values is 2+1=3. In this method, you don't peform the same computations multiple times.

Example Table of # of repeated items with their corresponding # of pairs

# of times repeated	  |     # of pairs
2	                    |       1
3	                    |       3
4	                    |       6
5	                    |       10
6	                    |       15


First we can count the frequency of each numbers using array. If a number appears n times, then n * (n â€“ 1) / 2 pairs can be made with this number.
