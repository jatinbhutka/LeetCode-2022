```python

        start = 0 
        end = len(nums) - 1
        
        while start <= end:
            mid = start + (end-start)//2            
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return True
            
            # the only difference from the previous solution,
            # if numbers at indexes start, mid, and end are same, we can't choose a side
            # the best we can do, is to skip one number from both ends as key != arr[mid]
            if nums[start] == nums[mid] and nums[end] == nums[mid]:
                start += 1
                end -= 1
            
            # left side is ascending order
            elif nums[start] <= nums[mid]:
                if target >= nums[start] and target < nums[mid]:
                    end = mid - 1
                else: # target > nums[mid]
                    start = mid + 1
            
            #right side is in asending order
            else:
                if target > nums[mid] and target <= nums[end]:
                    start = mid + 1
                else: 
                    end = mid - 1

#### Time complexity: O(log N)
This algorithm will run most of the times in O(logN) However, since we only skip two numbers in case of duplicates instead of half of the numbers, the worst case time complexity will become O(N)

#### Space complexity: O(1)
The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
