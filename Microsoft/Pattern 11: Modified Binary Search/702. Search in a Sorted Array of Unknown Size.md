#### Time complexity: O(Log N)
There are two parts of the algorithm. In the first part, we keep increasing the bound’s size exponentially (double it every time) while searching for the proper bounds. Therefore, this step will take O(logN) assuming that the array will have maximum ‘N’ numbers. In the second step, we perform the binary search which will take O(logN), so the overall time complexity of our algorithm will be O(logN + logN) which is asymptotically equivalent to O(logN)

#### Space complexity: O(1)
The algorithm runs in constant space O(1)
