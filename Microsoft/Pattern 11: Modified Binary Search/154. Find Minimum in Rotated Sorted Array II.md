# Complexity Analysis

#### Time complexity: log N
where NN is the length of the array, since in general it is a binary search algorithm. However, in the worst case where the array contains identical elements (i.e. case #3 nums[pivot]==nums[high]), the algorithm would deteriorate to iterating each element, as a result, the time complexity becomes O(N).

#### Space complexity : O(1), it's a constant space solution.
