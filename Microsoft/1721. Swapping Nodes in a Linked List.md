# 1721. Swapping Nodes in a Linked List:

You are given the head of a linked list, and an integer k.

Return the head of the linked list after swapping the values of the kth node from the beginning and the kth node from the end (the list is 1-indexed).

 
```
Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
```

```
Example 2:
Input: head = [7,9,6,6,7,8,3,0,9,5], k = 5
Output: [7,9,6,6,8,7,3,0,9,5]
``` 
```
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is n.
1 <= k <= n <= 105
0 <= Node.val <= 100
```

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def swapNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
        dum = ListNode(-1)
        dum.next = head
        
        prev = dum
        curr = head
        
        i = 0
        while i<k and curr:
            i += 1
            prev = curr
            curr = curr.next
            
        firstNode = prev
#        print(firstNode.val)
        
        curr = dum
        while prev:
            curr = curr.next
            prev = prev.next
            
        secondNode = curr
        
        firstNode.val, secondNode.val = secondNode.val, firstNode.val
        
        return dum.next
```


# Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity : O(n), where nn is the size of Linked List. We are iterating over the entire Linked List once.

### Space Complexity: O(1), as we are using constant extra space to maintain list node pointers frontNode, endNode and currentNode.
