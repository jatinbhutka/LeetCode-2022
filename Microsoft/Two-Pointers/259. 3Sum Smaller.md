# 259. 3Sum Smaller:

Given an array of n integers nums and an integer target, find the number of index triplets i, j, k with 0 <= i < j < k < n that satisfy the condition nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target.

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [-2,0,1,3], target = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:
[-2,0,1]
[-2,0,3]
```
```
Example 2:
Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: 0
```
```
Example 3:
Input: nums = [0], target = 0
Output: 0
```
```
Constraints:
n == nums.length
0 <= n <= 3500
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
-100 <= target <= 100
```

```python
class Solution:
    def threeSumSmaller(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        def twoSum (nums, startIndex, new_target):

            sum = 0
            i = startIndex
            j = len(nums) - 1
            while i < j:
                if (nums[i]+ nums[j] < new_target):
                    sum += j - i 
                    i += 1
                else:
                    j -=  1
            return sum
        nums.sort()        
        sum = 0
        for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
            new_target = target - nums[i]
            sum += twoSum(nums, i+1, new_target)
        return sum
       
```       


# Time complexity:
Sorting the array will take O(N * logN)O(Nâˆ—logN). The searchPair() will take O(N). So, overall searchTriplets() will take O(N * logN + N^2), which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N^2).

# Space complexity:
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) which is required for sorting if we are not using an in-place sorting algorithm.


```python
# 3Sum closer - return all the triplet:

def triplet_with_smaller_sum(arr, target):
  arr.sort()
  triplets = []
  for i in range(len(arr)-2):
    search_pair(arr, target - arr[i], i, triplets)
  return triplets


def search_pair(arr, target_sum, first, triplets):
  left = first + 1
  right = len(arr) - 1
  while (left < right):
    if arr[left] + arr[right] < target_sum:  # found the triplet
      # since arr[right] >= arr[left], therefore, we can replace arr[right] by any number between
      # left and right to get a sum less than the target sum
      for i in range(right, left, -1):
        triplets.append([arr[first], arr[left], arr[i]])
      left += 1
    else:
      right -= 1  # we need a pair with a smaller sum


def main():
  print(triplet_with_smaller_sum([-1, 0, 2, 3], 3))
  print(triplet_with_smaller_sum([-1, 4, 2, 1, 3], 5))


main()
```

# Time complexity:
Sorting the array will take O(N * logN). The searchPair(), in this case, will take O(N^2); the main while loop will run in O(N)O(N) but the nested for loop can also take O(N) - this will happen when the target sum is bigger than every triplet in the array.

So, overall searchTriplets() will take O(N * logN + N^3), which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N^3)

# Space complexity:
Ignoring the space required for the output array, the space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N)O(N) which is required for sorting.
