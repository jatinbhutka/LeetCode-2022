# 259. 3Sum Smaller:

Given an array of n integers nums and an integer target, find the number of index triplets i, j, k with 0 <= i < j < k < n that satisfy the condition nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target.

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [-2,0,1,3], target = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:
[-2,0,1]
[-2,0,3]
```
```
Example 2:
Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: 0
```
```
Example 3:
Input: nums = [0], target = 0
Output: 0
```
```
Constraints:
n == nums.length
0 <= n <= 3500
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
-100 <= target <= 100
```

```python
class Solution:
    def threeSumSmaller(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        def twoSum (nums, startIndex, new_target):

            sum = 0
            i = startIndex
            j = len(nums) - 1
            while i < j:
                if (nums[i]+ nums[j] < new_target):
                    sum += j - i 
                    i += 1
                else:
                    j -=  1
            return sum
        nums.sort()        
        sum = 0
        for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
            new_target = target - nums[i]
            sum += twoSum(nums, i+1, new_target)
        return sum
       
```       


# Time complexity:
Sorting the array will take O(N * logN)O(Nâˆ—logN). The searchPair() will take O(N)O(N). So, overall searchTriplets() will take O(N * logN + N^2), which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N^2).

# Space complexity:
The space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N)O(N) which is required for sorting if we are not using an in-place sorting algorithm.
