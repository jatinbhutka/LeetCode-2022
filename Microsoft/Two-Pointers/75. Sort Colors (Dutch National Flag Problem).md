75. Sort Colors (Dutch National Flag Problem):

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

 
```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```
```
Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]
``` 

```
Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 300
nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.
```

```py
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:

        # Brute Force: We can do sorting in NlogN time
        # Optimized: Bucket Sort as there is only 3 diff value - O(N) time
            # freq = [0,1,2] freq for 0,1,2. 
            # but this will take two pass.

        # More Optimized: In one Pass using quick sort.

        leftInd = 0
        rightInd = len(nums)-1
        ind = 0
        while ind <= rightInd:
            if nums[ind] == 0:
                nums[ind], nums[leftInd] = nums[leftInd], nums[ind]
                leftInd += 1
                ind += 1
            elif nums[ind] == 2:
                nums[ind], nums[rightInd] = nums[rightInd], nums[ind]
                rightInd -= 1
            else:
                ind += 1

```
