# 11. Container With Most Water:

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```
```
Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
 ```
 
```
Constraints:

n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104
```

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        max_area = 0
        for i in range(len(height)):
            for j in range(i, len(height)):
                max_height = min(height[i], height[j])
                max_area = max(max_area, max_height * (j-i))
                
        return max_area
```


```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        
        left = 0
        right = len(height) - 1
        max_area = 0
        while left < right:
            min_height = min(height[left], height[right])
            max_area = max(max_area, min_height * (right - left))
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        return max_area
```

# Complexity Analysis

### Time complexity : O(n)O(n). Single pass.

### Space complexity : O(1)O(1). Constant space is used.
