# 287. Find the Duplicate Number:

Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```
```
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
 ```
```
Constraints:

1 <= n <= 105
nums.length == n + 1
1 <= nums[i] <= n
All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.
 ```

Follow up:

How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums?
Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?

# Solution:
This problem follows the Cyclic Sort pattern and shares similarities with Find the Missing Number. Following a similar approach, we will try to place each number on its correct index. Since there is only one duplicate, if while swapping the number with its index both the numbers being swapped are same, we have found our duplicate!

# Altering nums array
```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        i = 0
        while i < len(nums):
            j = nums[i] - 1
            if i != j and nums[i] == nums[j]:
                return nums[i]
            elif nums[i] != nums[j]:
                nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
            else:
                i += 1
        return -1
        
```
# Time complexity : O(n) 
# Space complexity is O(1)


# without altering Nums array - Using marking visited number

```python
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
        # Marked Elemenet of the index as visited:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            j = abs(nums[i]) - 1
            if nums[j] < 0:
                duplicate = abs(nums[i])
                break
            if nums[j] > 0:
                nums[j] *= -1
  
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            nums[i] = abs(nums[i])
        return duplicate
```
