# 41. First Missing Positive:

Given an unsorted integer array nums, return the smallest missing positive integer.

You must implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses constant extra space.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,0]
Output: 3
```
```
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
```
```
Example 3:

Input: nums = [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1
 ```
```
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 105
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
```

# ** O/p will be between 1 and n+1 **

This problem follows the Cyclic Sort pattern and shares similarities with Find the Missing Number with one big difference. In this problem, the numbers are not bound by any range so we can have any number in the input array.

However, we will follow a similar approach though as discussed in Find the Missing Number to place the numbers on their correct indices and ignore all numbers that are out of the range of the array (i.e., all negative numbers and all numbers greater than or equal to the length of the array). Once we are done with the cyclic sort we will iterate the array and the first index that does not have the correct number will be the smallest missing positive number!

        ind = 0
        while ind < len(nums):
            nextInd = nums[ind] - 1
            if nextInd >= 0 and nextInd < len(nums) and nums[ind] != nums[nextInd]:
                nums[ind], nums[nextInd] = nums[nextInd], nums[ind]
            else:
                ind += 1
                
        for ind, num in enumerate(nums):
            if ind + 1 != num:
                return ind + 1

        if maxNum < 0: ## THIS IS IMP, IF NUMS contain all <0 num.

            if j < len(nums) and nums[i] > 0 and nums[i] != nums[j]  :
                nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
            else:

            if i+1 != nums[i]:
                return i+1
        return len(nums) + 1   
```


# Time complexity: O(n)
The time complexity of the above algorithm is O(n)

# Space complexity: O(1)
The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).

# Algorithm:

Now everything is ready to write down the algorithm.

- Check if 1 is present in the array. If not, you're done and 1 is the answer.
- Replace negative numbers, zeros, and numbers larger than n by 1s.
- Walk along the array. Change the sign of a-th element if you meet number a. Be careful with duplicates : do sign change only once. Use index 0 to save an information about presence of number n since index n is not available.
- Walk again along the array. Return the index of the first positive element.
- If nums[0] > 0 return n.
- If on the previous step you didn't find the positive element in nums, that means that the answer is n + 1.

class Solution:
    def firstMissingPositive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        
        # Base case.
        if 1 not in nums:
            return 1
        
        # Replace negative numbers, zeros,
        # and numbers larger than n by 1s.
        # After this convertion nums will contain 
        # only positive numbers.
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] <= 0 or nums[i] > n:
                nums[i] = 1
        
        # Use index as a hash key and number sign as a presence detector.
        # For example, if nums[1] is negative that means that number `1`
        # is present in the array. 
        # If nums[2] is positive - number 2 is missing.
        for i in range(n): 
            a = abs(nums[i])
            # If you meet number a in the array - change the sign of a-th element.
            # Be careful with duplicates : do it only once.
            if a == n:
                nums[0] = - abs(nums[0])
            else:
                nums[a] = - abs(nums[a])
            
        # Now the index of the first positive number 
        # is equal to first missing positive.
        for i in range(1, n):
            if nums[i] > 0:
                return i
        
        if nums[0] > 0:
            return n
            
        return n + 1
```
