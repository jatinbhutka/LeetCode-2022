A. The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is --> 2^l. 

Level of root Node is 0, l = 0, number of nodes = 2^0 = 1

Assume that the maximum number of nodes on level ‘l’ is 2l.

Since in Binary tree every node has at most 2 children, next level would have twice nodes, i.e. 2 * 2^l 


B. The Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is 2^h – 1. 

C. In a Binary Tree with N nodes, minimum possible height or the minimum number of levels is? Log2(N+1) ?   

D. A Binary Tree with L leaves has at least | Log2L? |+ 1   levels 

E. In Binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children, the number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.

```
L = T + 1
Where,
  L = Number of leaf nodes
  T = Number of internal nodes with two children

Proof:
No. of leaf nodes (L) i.e. total elements present at the bottom of tree = 2^(h-1) (h is height of tree)
No. of internal nodes = {total no. of nodes} - {leaf nodes} 
                      = { 2^h - 1 } - {2^(h-1)} = 2^(h-1) (2-1) - 1 = 2^(h-1) - 1
So , L = 2^(h-1)
     T = 2^(h-1) - 1
Therefore L = T + 1
Hence proved
