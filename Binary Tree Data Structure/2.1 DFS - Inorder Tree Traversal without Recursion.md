# 2.1 DFS - Inorder Tree Traversal without Recursion.md:

Using Stack is the obvious way to traverse tree without recursion. Below is an algorithm for traversing binary tree using stack. See this for step wise step execution of the algorithm. 

1) Create an empty stack S.
2) Initialize current node as root
3) Push the current node to S and set current = current->left until current is NULL
4) If current is NULL and stack is not empty then 
     a) Pop the top item from stack.
     b) Print the popped item, set current = popped_item->right 
     c) Go to step 3.
5) If current is NULL and stack is empty then we are done.
Let us consider the below tree for example  
```
            1
          /   \
        2      3
      /  \
    4     5
```

```
Step 1 Creates an empty stack: S = NULL

Step 2 sets current as address of root: current -> 1

Step 3 Pushes the current node and set current = current->left 
       until current is NULL
     current -> 1
     push 1: Stack S -> 1
     current -> 2
     push 2: Stack S -> 2, 1
     current -> 4
     push 4: Stack S -> 4, 2, 1
     current = NULL

Step 4 pops from S
     a) Pop 4: Stack S -> 2, 1
     b) print "4"
     c) current = NULL /*right of 4 */ and go to step 3
Since current is NULL step 3 doesn't do anything. 

Step 4 pops again.
     a) Pop 2: Stack S -> 1
     b) print "2"
     c) current -> 5/*right of 2 */ and go to step 3

Step 3 pushes 5 to stack and makes current NULL
     Stack S -> 5, 1
     current = NULL

Step 4 pops from S
     a) Pop 5: Stack S -> 1
     b) print "5"
     c) current = NULL /*right of 5 */ and go to step 3
Since current is NULL step 3 doesn't do anything

Step 4 pops again.
     a) Pop 1: Stack S -> NULL
     b) print "1"
     c) current -> 3 /*right of 1 */  

Step 3 pushes 3 to stack and makes current NULL
     Stack S -> 3
     current = NULL

Step 4 pops from S
     a) Pop 3: Stack S -> NULL
     b) print "3"
     c) current = NULL /*right of 3 */  

Traversal is done now as stack S is empty and current is NULL

# Python program to do inorder traversal without recursion
 
# A binary tree node
class Node:
     
    # Constructor to create a new node

            # Place pointer to a tree node on the stack
            # before traversing the node's left subtree
            stack.append(current)
         
            current = current.left
 
         
        # BackTrack from the empty subtree and visit the Node
        # at the top of the stack; however, if the stack is
        # empty you are done
        elif(stack):
            current = stack.pop()
            print(current.data, end=" ") # Python 3 printing
         
            # We have visited the node and its left
            # subtree. Now, it's right subtree's turn
            current = current.right
 
        else:
            break
      
    print()
```


##### Time Complexity: O(n)

```
1. Initialize current as root 
2. While current is not NULL
   If the current does not have left child
      a) Print current’s data
      b) Go to the right, i.e., current = current->right
   Else
      a) Find rightmost node in current left subtree OR
              node whose right child == current.
         If we found right child == current
             a) Update the right child as NULL of that node whose right child is current
             b) Print current’s data
             c) Go to the right, i.e. current = current->right
         Else
             a) Make current as the right child of that rightmost 
                node we found; and 
             b) Go to this left child, i.e., current = current->left
