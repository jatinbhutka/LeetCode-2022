# find the size of binary tree:

Size of a tree is the number of elements present in the tree. Size of the below tree is 5.

Algorithm:
Size() function recursively calculates the size of a tree. It works as follows:
Size of a tree = Size of left subtree + 1 + Size of right subtree.

```python
# Python Program to find the size of binary tree
 
# A binary tree node
class Node:
 
    # Constructor to create a new node
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
 
# Computes the number of nodes in tree
def size(node):
    if node is None:
        return 0
    else:
        return (size(node.left)+ 1 + size(node.right))
 
 
# Driver program to test above function
root = Node(1)
root.left = Node(2)
root.right = Node(3)
root.left.left  = Node(4)
root.left.right = Node(5)
 
print("Size of the tree is %d" %(size(root)))
```
