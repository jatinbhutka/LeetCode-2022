Django is a free and open-source web application framework written in Python. It is used for rapid web development and clean, pragmatic design. It is built by experienced developers to make repetitive tasks easier, so we can focus on writing apps instead of reinventing the wheel.


# The Django community:

The Django framework is extremely large, but the Django community is absolutely massive. The community has contributed a lot of third party code for Django. No matter what we are trying to do, thereâ€™s a good chance that we will find the solution for it on djangopackages.org. The website includes everything, from authentication and authorization to full-on Django-powered content management systems, from e-commerce add-ons to integrations with Stripe.
