# Django:

In this tutorial you get a step by step guide on how to install and create a Django project. You will learn how to create a model where you can create, read, update or delete data.

You will learn how to make HTML Templates and use Django Template Tags to insert data within a HTML document.

You will learn how to work with QuerySets to extract, filter, and sort data from the database.

```
### Django is especially helpful for database driven websites.

Django follows the MVT design pattern (Model View Template).

Model - The data you want to present, usually data from a database.
View - A request handler that returns the relevant template and content - based on the request from the user.
Template - A text file (like an HTML file) containing the layout of the web page, with logic on how to display the data.
```

```
So, What is Going On?
When you have installed Django and created your first Django web application, and the browser requests the URL, this is basically what happens:

- Django receives the URL, checks the urls.py file, and calls the view that matches the URL.
- The view, located in views.py, checks for relevant models.
- The models are imported from the models.py file.
- The view then sends the data to a specified template in the template folder.
- The template contains HTML and Django tags, and with the data it returns finished HTML content back to the browser.
```

Django is a free and open-source web application framework written in Python. It is used for rapid web development and clean, pragmatic design. It is built by experienced developers to make repetitive tasks easier, so we can focus on writing apps instead of reinventing the wheel.


# The Django community:

The Django framework is extremely large, but the Django community is absolutely massive. The community has contributed a lot of third party code for Django. No matter what we are trying to do, thereâ€™s a good chance that we will find the solution for it on djangopackages.org. The website includes everything, from authentication and authorization to full-on Django-powered content management systems, from e-commerce add-ons to integrations with Stripe.
