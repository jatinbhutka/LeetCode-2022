#### React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is an open-source, component-based front-end library that is responsible only for the view layer of the application. ReactJS is not a framework, it is just a library developed by Facebook to solve some problems that we were facing earlier.

##### Open Source Javascript library for building user interfaces. Not a framework. Focus on UI. It does not support HTML request but its support high user friendly UI interface.

##### React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture-based library that plays the role of “V” which means view. It designs simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right component when your data changes. The declarative view makes your code more predictable and easier to debug.

- Helps in building full fledge web application.

#### React Features:

###### Use JSX: JSX is faster than normal JavaScript as it performs optimizations while translating to regular JavaScript. It makes it easier for us to create templates.

###### Virtual DOM: Virtual DOM exists which is like a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. So for every object that exists in the original DOM, there is an object for that in React Virtual DOM. It is exactly the same, but it does not have the power to directly change the layout of the document. Manipulating DOM is slow, but manipulating Virtual DOM is fast as nothing gets drawn on the screen.

###### One-way Data Binding: One-way data binding gives you better view over your application.

###### Component: A Component is one of the core building blocks of React. In other words, we can say that every application you will develop in React will be made up of pieces called components. Components make the task of building UIs much easier.

###### Performance: ReactJS use JSX, which is faster compared to normal JavaScript and HTML. Virtual DOM is a less time taking procedure to update webpages content.

Architecture:
- Component based architecture.
- Can be made reusable by component.
