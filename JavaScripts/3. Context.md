# 3. Context:

 The Javascript global scope is the context where everything in a Javascript program executes by default. This scope includes all variables, objects, and references that are not contained within a customized scope defined by a programmer. Global scope is the entire Javascript execution environment.
 
 
 In Node. js, that means an object with information related to Node. In the browser, the global context is the Window object. If you run a file in strict mode, then JavaScript leaves this undefined if it's not actually set.
 
 
Context will be available to you.
- Global context: collect information as we write program
- executable context: When we execute prograam/ function, Executable context will be activated. They will executed as Memory stack.
